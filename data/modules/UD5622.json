Methods of urban analysis and urban design will be taught to enable the students to tackle urban design projects of varying scales introduced in UD5601 and UD5602. The various aspects of urban growth, city limits/boundaries, urban structure, urban architecture, typologies as well as infrastructural planning, parcellation, public space and design guidelines will be introduced.
