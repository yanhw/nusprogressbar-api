"moduleDescription": "The module hopes to show a critical evaluation of human-nature relationships in different societies and culture groups, and seeks to demonstrate that different human-nature relationships can provide important underpinnings to understanding the obstacles to development programmes on how best to tap these relationships for sustainable development. Besides defining nature, environment, ecosystems, the module discusses human-nature relationship in gender; religion; political ideology and economics. This multi-disciplinary module is targeted at students from the Faculties of Arts and Social Sciences, Law, Engineering and School of Design and Environment.",
