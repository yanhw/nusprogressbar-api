"moduleDescription": "We begin with a discussion of the peculiar pleasure of watching horror films, asking why this popular genre continues to proliferate globally. What is the appeal of violence and images of horror or abjection, and what is the role of self-reflexivity in this pleasure? We pay close attention to spectator affect and raise the ethical implications of what one might call \u201cbad looking,\u201d grounding our discussion not only in the conventions of the horror genre and its subgenres, but in close formal attention to each film. The course readings raise diverse issues from differing perspectives and contextualize our discussion.",
