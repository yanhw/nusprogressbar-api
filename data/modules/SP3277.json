"moduleDescription": "This module exposes senior students to nanoscience research and nanotechnology-based industry. This is done through a series of weekly seminars by principal investigators and industrial experts in the field, laboratory and industrial visits, and by completion of nanosynthesis/nanocharacterization-related mini projects. The course culminates in an intensive one-week study tour to Japan, organised in collaboration with La Trobe University and Tokyo University",
