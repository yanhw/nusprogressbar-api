"moduleDescription": "This course prepares students for computer engineering. It is intended to teach basic circuit principles in electrical engineering. The course covers DC and AC circuit analysis techniques and applications. The circuit principles are enhanced through a series of miniprojects which shall be carried out by students in groups of 2 or 3. In this course, students also learn about the importance of resourcefulness, teamwork, integrity and communications.",
