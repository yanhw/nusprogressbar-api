"moduleDescription": "This course introduces and examines the idea of a \u201csystem\u201d. It explores systems theory as a way of thinking about the goals, boundaries, complexities, stakeholders, and relationships between parts of a larger network (social, economic, knowledge-based etc). Topics include characteristics of a system, inter-relationships between different parts of a system, the effects of a system on its stakeholders and vice versa, and the limits and challenges of systems theory. Different national and community systems will be introduced. Students will also have the opportunity to investigate a system of their choice.",
