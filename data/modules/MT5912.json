"moduleDescription": "Frugal Innovation is a unique action-learning experience that assembles cross-disciplinary teams of undergraduate and graduate students from Engineering and Business at NUS into focused projects. The objective of the projects is to build solutions for specific problems in the emerging Asian markets such as India and Indonesia. These problems usually require new frugal solutions that are simple, cost-conscious and \u201cgood enough\u201d \u2013 requirements that existing technologies do not satisfy. Frugal Innovation challenges students to apply out-of-the-box thinking, deep creativity and ability to combine technologies in a unique way to design such solutions. In this course students work closely with customers to discover what is simple & \u201cgood enough\u201d, design the product to address customer needs and validate a business model that can sustain the roll-out of the product.",
