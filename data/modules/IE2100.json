"moduleDescription": "The module builds upon the foundation in ST2131 and stresses on applications of stochastic modeling. Topics include: Review of exponential distribution; Conditional probability and conditional expectation; discrete time Markov chains; Poisson process; Basic queuing models and continuous time Markov chains and Renewal Theory. Students will eventually be conversant with the properties of these models and appreciate their roles in engineering applications.",
