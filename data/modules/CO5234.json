"moduleDescription": "Two of the most important skills that public health practitioners need to develop are program design and proposal writing. These two skills are inseparably linked: they are two sides of the same coin. A poorly designed project or program will have very little chance of successfully competing for funds, while an innovative, wellconceived project will never get funded unless it gets written into a good proposal. A good program design in a good proposal can lead to better implementation and management, and sets the stage for good monitoring and evaluation. In turn, a project executed well has better chances for re-funding and expansion by donors. This skills building design, monitoring and evaluation (DME) course is designed to introduce the potential proposal writer to the working environment that he will eventually confront repeatedly. It requires living through the process of applying good principles of program/project design in developing a proposal. Remarks: It is recommended that students have completed CO5102 Principles of Epidemiology and CO5103 Quantitative Epidemiologic Methods prior to reading this module",
