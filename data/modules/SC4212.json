"moduleDescription": "This module examines new studies on memory as a social phenomenon. Not just for individuals, but for all kinds of social groups, memory is an indissoluble part of identity. Remembering is always a selective reconstruction, hence always political. 'Popular' (often oral) memory interacts with 'official' history, while itself containing differences relating to generation, class, gender and ethnicity. Memories of traumatic events of the C20th shape our moral universe and are driving developments in international human rights law. Our explorations of the politics of memory will be grounded in case studies of both regional and global relevance.",
