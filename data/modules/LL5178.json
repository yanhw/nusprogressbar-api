"moduleDescription": "This course will examine the treaties used by States to protect the interests of their investors when making investments abroad. It will pay particular attention to investor-State arbitration, which is increasingly becoming widespread in Asia and a growing part of international legal practice. It will examine not only the legal and theoretical underpinnings of these treaties and this form of dispute settlement, but also their practical application having regard to concrete cases.",
