"moduleDescription": "This module introduces students to skills necessary for writing an academic essay. It does so by facilitating students' ability to think critically about the relationship between the concepts of \"danger\"and \"national security\". In particular, it asks if the process by which danger is identified by national communities are unquestionable and self-evident, or if they are historically contigent and mutable. In this regard, is \"danger\"constructed to foster national solidarity and identity? This module examines different cultural and political texts attesting to the changing nature of the national security community, and uses them as the basis of teaching the elements of essay writing.",
