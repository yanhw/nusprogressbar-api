"moduleDescription": "This elective course introduces students to fundamental concepts of numerical analysis as a powerful tool for solving engineering problems. Basic concepts of errors, Taylor series, matrix methods, and curve-fitting techniques will be introduced, with emphasis on simple examples and applications derived from mechanical engineering disciplines. Brief introductions to the finite difference and finite element methods will be given. The treatment will primarily use the Laplace and Diffusion equations as illustrations of analysis familiar to mechanical engineers. The course will also introduce the use of the software Matlab as a tool for the solution of numerical problems.",
