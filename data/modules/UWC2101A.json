"moduleDescription": "This module teaches writing and critical thinking through a critical exploration of the notion of cosmopolitanism and its relation to colonialism. Topics discussed include the origin of cosmopolitanism, the relevance of cosmopolitanism as a moral ideal in the age of globalization, and the formation of cultural identity among diasporic Asians. The module thus provides the chance for students to reflect on the notion of global citizenship in the contemporary world, as well as their responsibilities as cosmopolitan citizens.",
