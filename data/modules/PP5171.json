"moduleDescription": "The purpose of this course is to provide students with a \u2018toolbox\u2019 and working knowledge of advanced crosssectional and panel data econometric techniques frequently used in applied microeconomic policy analysis and research. This course will cover major extensions to the standard OLS regression model and provide students with an introduction to the \u2018cutting edge\u2019 techniques used today to evaluate microeconomic theories and policies, including instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, matching estimators, regression discontinuity and quantile regressions. The emphasis of the course will be on estimating causal relationships that can then be used to make predictions about the consequences of changing a policy.",
