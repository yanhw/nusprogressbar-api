"moduleDescription": "This module introduces the student to the fundamental issues of cognitive science. Specifically, the main concern is how we might model cognition. The topics include the modes of representation, issues relating to the processing of information, and the nature of cognitive architectures. Both classical models of cognition and connectionist models will be considered. There will be several sessions of computer simulation of basic connectionist models. This course is mounted for students interested in how we might study how the mind works.",
