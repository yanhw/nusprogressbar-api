These range from explaining the development of science, including a comparison with traditional approaches, to understanding nature in both the West and the East, to problems of the rationality of science. This will also involve a historical study of the development of philosophy of science in the Western tradition, from Bacon and Hume, through Mill, to Popper, Kuhn and Feyerabend.",
