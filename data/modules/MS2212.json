"moduleDescription": "This module examines dominant perceptions of law in Malay society by focussing on ideas on adat law and Islamization of laws. It analyses socio-historical factors conditioning perspectives and the function of ideas in relation to social groups that espouse them. The extent to which the mode of thinking on adat law is reflected in discourse on Islamising laws and its impact on legal development will be addressed. Concepts of ideology and Orientalism, Islam and adat law, Ideas on Islamization of laws and Shariah and the state are some major themes tackled.",
