We will examine the literary and visual representations of the city in modern China through close analyses of the novels, short stories, films, and photographs that illuminate Chinese urbanism. The cultural manifestations of such Chinese metropolises as Shanghai and Beijing will be extensively discussed. Also, Hong Kong and Taipei will be included.",
