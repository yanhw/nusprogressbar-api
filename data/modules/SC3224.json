"moduleDescription": "The course is intended as a 'capstone' to unify and ground the Cultural Studies Minor. As such, it explores the critical tradition from which Cultural Studies emerged and examines some of the directions that this critical tradition went as it encountered and modified institutions and institutional practice in the 20th and 21st centuries. Students gain additional coverage and depth as they work the theoretical terrain underpinning all courses in the minor while also generating essays and projects that reveal this critical ground in an applied fashion.",
