The main concerns of this module are issues pertaining to modern society and capitalist development, referring to diverse cases from Western Europe to Southeast Asia. We will also be looking at the state, civil society and societal movements, including that of labour, and such contentious contemporary issues as economic globalization, US global hegemony, and terrorism.",
