"moduleDescription": "This module teaches a critical appreciation of visual media (photography, film, video) as important documentary resources in the social sciences, and as distinctive modes of representation. A wide range of ethnographic films will be analyzed. The powers of a visual language to say things differently from text, or to show things that cannot be said in writing, will be examined. This module will not only help enhance the marketability of our students but also encourage them to take on the post-graduate programme where a more hands-on module is offered.",
