"moduleDescription": "Positive Psychology is the study of how people thrive despite external obstacles and their own human frailties. The aim of this course is to address questions such as: What are the positive psychological mind-states and action sequences that promote flourishing lives, and how can we live life well? What are the behaviours and cognitions that undermine wellbeing? This course will introduce students to the scientific research and issues in positive psychology, and will explore the meaning and implications of positive psychology towards a global understanding of wellbeing.",
