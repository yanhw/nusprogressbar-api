"moduleDescription": "The Indian presence has had considerable influence on the development of Southeast Asian societies: in terms of its economic, commercial and political influence; and its role in the everyday life of Southeast Asian multicultural societies. Adopting a multidisciplinary approach, this module seeks to examine the historical, political, social and economic development of the people from the Indian subcontinent who have come to settle in Southeast Asia. The module will provide students with the necessary framework to analyse the historical and socio-economic development of these communities and their identity concerns. The module will develop critical and analytical skills guiding students in the process of social scientific enquiry.",
