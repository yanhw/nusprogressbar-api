It is intended for students who have little or only average second language reading ability in Mandarin. Topics include the fundamentals of Classical Chinese grammar and readings from philosophical texts written in Classical Chinese from different periods. This module will provide the language foundation required for students intending to do graduate work in Chinese Philosophy, and enable them to work with primary materials.",
