"moduleDescription": "This module adopts an ecological and systems approach to discussing the composition, functioning and inter-relationships between major ecosystem types and the soils, fauna and flora found within. Subjects covered include ecological processes; the ecosystems concept and ecosystems functioning (including biogeochemical and energy fluxes). Basic principles will be developed as a basis for the examination and comparison of humid tropical systems with better understood temperate environments.",
