"moduleDescription": "This module introduces students to some of the most important legal systems in the world, with a particular emphasis on Asia. Systems that are explored include the civil law in particular, as well as Islamic law, Chinese law, the law of Southeast Asian jurisdictions and transnational law. Exploration focuses largely on the institutional and intellectual structure of these systems both individually and in comparison, and will also use examples and case studies to illustrate aspects of the systems discussed. The course gives students sufficient insight into these systems to facilitate effective autonomous research and a basic familiarity with the systems that should prove useful in later professional life.",
