"moduleDescription": "A reading of one of the greatest novels in Russian, European, and world literature, with primary attention to interrelations of theme, form, and literary-cultural context. Through a reading of the Introduction to the instructor\u2019s book on Anna Karenina, and discussions organized around leading questions that focus on the text of the novel, the course will also introduce students to a reading methodology that is applicable to literature in general and that seeks to avoid the kinds of ideological mediations that are common in academic literary study.",
