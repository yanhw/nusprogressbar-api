"moduleDescription": "This module will introduce students to principles of terrestrial ecology. Major topics will include diversity and distributions of terrestrial environments, soils and nutrient cycling, animal-plant interactions [pollination, seed dispersal, herbivory], disturbance ecology and succession, energy flow and food webs, population biology, and fragmentation. The course will have a strong quantitative focus. The module will also cover ecological processes in rural (agricultural) and urban terrestrial environments.",
