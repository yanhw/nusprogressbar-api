"moduleDescription": "Transnational information producers are shaping the global Information Society in diverse ways. 'Information' comes in many forms and their production, dissemination and consumption in different socio-political contexts need to be critically analyzed. Students will examine many new trends, issues, practices, power relations, and case studies from different theoretical perspectives. They will critically analyze important phenomena that have 'transnational' dimensions, such as emerging practices of global journalism, global visual cultures, media representations of major events, environmental communication, international political communication, digital public diplomacy, place branding, and transnational business-related communicative practices such as branding, advertising, and consumers' expressions of resistance.",
