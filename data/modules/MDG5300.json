"moduleDescription": "Nutrition is crucial for sustenance. Besides the availability of nutrition, intake of food is vital to health and well-being. Therefore, the desire to eat food (Appetite) and satiety has a tremendous impact on metabolism and health. The overall mechanisms for appetite and satiety regulation are complex and multifactorial. The focus of this module is to understand biochemical and molecular processes involved in appetite and nutrition intake. Students will gain fundamental knowledge on how various signalling mechanisms in the body collaborate to stimulate or stop food intake.",
