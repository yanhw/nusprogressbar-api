"moduleDescription": "This module provides an understanding of the tropical coastal ecosystems and evaluates various approaches and techniques to achieve sustainable coastal management. The issues for discussion include sea level rise, beach erosion, coral reefs degradation, mangroves depletion, small-scale tourism development, and coastal management strategies of small island states. Case studies are taken mainly from Southeast Asia. The module should appeal to all geography students taking an applied approach to coastal management.",
