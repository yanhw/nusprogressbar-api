"moduleDescription": "In the light of emerging global interest in solar photovoltaic electricity as a clean and renewable energy source, the government of Singapore has taken a keen interest in establishing a strong local photovoltaics (PV) industry. The Engineering Science Programme in NUS will play a significant role in the related specialist manpower training programme due to the existing specializations in Energy Systems as well as Nanoscience and Nanotechnology. This course addresses fundamental issues related to improving the efficiency of photovoltaic devices, and will cover the mechanisms of charge carrier generation, recombination, and transport. This module is available to selected students from other departments as a part of the FoE solar energy specialist manpower training programme.",
