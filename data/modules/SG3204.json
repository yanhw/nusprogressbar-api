"moduleDescription": "The aim of this course is to teach how to design effective Human-Computer Interfaces (HCI) The course begins by explaining that the success of a software application may be critically dependent upon it?s HCI Topics included in the course are principles of HCI design; interface design process; design criteria; scripting and story boarding; evaluating and testing the interface; Web and mobile interface design and tools for interface design. There are case study workshops using interface tools. There will be a design/prototyping project. This course is appropriate for all software developers who wish to construct effective HCIs for software applications.",
