"moduleDescription": "International law traditionally concerns itself with the relations between states, yet environmental problems transcend borders. International environmental law demonstrates how international norms can affect national sovereignty on matters of common concern. The course surveys international treaties concerning the atmosphere and the conservation of nature, and connections to trade and economic development. Institutions and principles to promote compliance and cooperation are also examined. The course will assist students in their understanding of international law-making. It would be of use to those interested in careers involving international law, both for the government and public sector and those in international trade and investment.",
