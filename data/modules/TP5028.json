"moduleDescription": "The module will critically examine the dimensions of an integrated inter-modal transport system in relation to the changing logistics and supply chain practices of procurement, production and distribution. Themes and issues studied include the analysis of inter-modal choices using the total cost concepts in distribution, the international-domestic interface, advanced technologies in inter-modalism, the role of government in inter-modal integration. The module will also introduce simulation analysis for multi-modal operations, including building, calibration and validating models, output analysis and application programming interface.",
