"moduleDescription": "This course will introduce to students the substantive and procedural framework of international criminal law. We will study international criminal law's historical origins, evolution, and how it is implemented today through a variety of different institutional frameworks. Among others, we will study post-WWII tribunals, the ad hoc international tribunals of Yugoslavia and Rwanda, hybrid tribunals, military tribunals and the permanent International Criminal Court. We will also examine non-criminal law responses to international crimes such as truth and reconciliation commissions. Students will critically explore and question the pros and cons of international criminal justice in terms of its professed goals and objectives.",
