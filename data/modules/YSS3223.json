"moduleDescription": "In highly problematic ways Asian Medical Systems are colonial, Orientalist constructs that have been heavily influenced by nationalism and the modernity of religion. It is common to speak of Ayurveda (\u201cIndian\u201d medicine), Unani (Greek/Arabic/\u201dIslamic\u201d medicine), Traditional Chinese Medicine and Tibetan Buddhist Medicine as though these are timeless, authentic, self-contained traditions. Drawing on a range of contemporary theoretical insights in anthropology and history this course examines the way in which forms of \u201cmedical\u201d knowledge and embodied practice in Asia are shaped by the cultural dynamics of pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial globalization.",
