"moduleDescription": "Decision making technologies can support decision making in the financial, operational, marketing and other areas. Efforts have been directed at finding new machine learning (ML) techniques for decision making and their possible application in solving practical problems. ML techniques such as artificial neural network methods have been proven to be powerful tools for decision making. Applications include credit rating, bankruptcy analysis, foreign exchange rate predictions and many others. The techniques covered in this course include neural networks for classification/ regression/ clustering, genetic algorithm for optimisation, decision tree methods, support vector machine and data mining.",
