"moduleDescription": "This course provides students with a critical understanding of the debates among social scientists in Asia surrounding efforts to generate theories and concepts that not only reflect Asian empirical realities and concerns but are also rooted in Asian philosophical traditions as well as everyday life. The module begins with an overview of the variety of critiques of the social sciences that have emanated from Asia. The rest of the module discusses Asian attempts to develop what has come to be known as indigenous, alternative social sciences or autonomous traditions in the social sciences.",
