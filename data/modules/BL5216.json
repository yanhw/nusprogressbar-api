"moduleDescription": "The module is directed toward graduates with basic molecular biology and genetic backgrounds who are interested in conducting genomics-based research. The module will also introduce the unique aspects of different model organisms and approaches to understand their gene function.The module aims to equip the students with the latest knowledge on characterizing and understanding genomes in the broadest sense.Upon completion of the module, the students will be able to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of large scale genomic studies. They will also be able to apply the modern genetic techniques across different model organisms.",
