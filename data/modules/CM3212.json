"moduleDescription": "This module covers the chemistry of d-block and f-block metals. An introduction to observed trend in physical and chemical properties of d-block transition metal complexes will be given. A comprehensive discussion on their electronic structures and spectra follows. Magnetic property, ligand substitution and redox reaction of these metal complexes will be illustrated. The f-block metals will be introduced leading to a discussion of the optical spectra of their complexes. Introduction to inorganic supramolecular chemistry, crystal engineering and solid state chemistry will be covered.",
