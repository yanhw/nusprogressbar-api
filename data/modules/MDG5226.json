"moduleDescription": "With the dramatic increase in antibiotic resistance and the paucity in the development of new drugs we are in a transition phase to a pre-antibiotic like era with major implications for public health and clinical practice. Here, we will discuss two major topics: i) mechanisms of action of antibiotics and resistance, ii) concepts of antibacterial drug discovery, including target product profile, target and lead finding, and lead optimization.",
