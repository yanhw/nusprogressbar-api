"moduleDescription": "Nanotechnology is a relatively new field, and there is still controversy over its future potential. This module aims to acquaint students with the current topics in nanoscience, while engaging them in a dialogue on future possibilities, as well as the social and environmental implications of nanotechnology. Students will first be introduced to fundamentals of the nanoscale and learn to appreciate what the world is like when things are shrunk to this scale. They will then explore the special tools and fabrication methods required and have some hands-on experience with nano-instrumentation in a group project.",
