"moduleDescription": "This module presents Geography majors who are taking/ intend to declare GIS minor a unique opportunity to gain practical experience in using GIS. It allows the students to apply their geospatial technology skills, such as spatial database management, data visualization, and data analysis, in a real working environment. Through mentoring from internship managers of employing companies/public sectors and NUS advisors, students are trained to apply theoretical aspects of GIS for solving real-world problems. They will also be able to collaborate with colleagues from the employing company or agency, and develop research questions involving the use of GIS in environmental issues.",
