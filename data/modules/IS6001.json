"moduleDescription": "This is a practical course in applying the theories of case study research methodology. Lectures will cover in-depth the advantages and pitfalls of conducting research with the case study approach. Along with theoretical discussions, students have to put theory to practice by conducting a sizable case study research project, with intensive work over a 3-month period, in groups of 3 to 4 members. Each team will have a chance to present the research questions, to revise these questions and present a research plan of how evidence will be collected and analysed, and to prepare the final report.",
