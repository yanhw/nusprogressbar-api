"moduleDescription": "This module is intended to provide a good foundation and stimulate students\u2019 interest in specialized topics in Genetics and Genomics related to translational research. The module will provide students with knowledge of current practices in Genetic Medicine. Students will also know how gene identification, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are formulated and performed. They will also be expected to show how to translate new genetic and genomic discoveries into novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Major topics covered are gene identification, genetic diagnosis, and gene therapy. Ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) in genetic medicine will also be covered.",
