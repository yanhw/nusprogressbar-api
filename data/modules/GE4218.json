"moduleDescription": "New social and cultural trends have emerged impacting tourism in significant ways. Some of these trends include the ageing of populations, the acceptance of alternative sexualities, desire and awareness for personal health and wellness, and advances in information technology. All these have affected tourism practices and landscapes. The module intends to highlight and critically analyse these contemporary issues and their implications on society and space. It will also explore the negotiations between individuals, groups and the state in defining and materialising the spaces of tourism consumption. Both metaphorical and empiricist spaces will be examined for how they shape the enjoyment of leisure.",
