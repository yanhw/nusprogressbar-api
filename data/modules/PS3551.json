"moduleDescription": "A UROP involves the student working with a supervisor, and usually in a team, on an existing research project. It has relevance to the student\u2019s Major, and involves the application of subject knowledge, methodology and theory in reflection upon the research project. UROPs usually take place within FASS or ARI, though a few involve international partners. All are vetted and approved by the Major department. All are assessed. UROPs can be proposed by supervisor or student, and require the approval of the Major department.",
