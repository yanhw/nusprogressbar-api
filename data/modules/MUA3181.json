It is intended to build on their experiences in previous brass orchestral repertoire modules and Conservatory Orchestra, and focus their knowledge on how to prepare and execute professional orchestral auditions. In this module, each ACOR student will prepare ten standard orchestral excerpts for their instrument to a professional performance level. In preparing each excerpt, the student is also expected to research supporting materials in order to gain a broader technical and musicological understanding of their chosen repertoire.",
