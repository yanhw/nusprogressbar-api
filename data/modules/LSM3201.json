"moduleDescription": "This module introduces students to the philosophy, principles and processes of life sciences research and communication. It aims to equip students with the essential knowledge that complements the hands-on research training which students undertake for UROPS and Honours projects\u2019 requirements. The module covers the essentials of scientific research including: importances and pitfalls of problem formulation and hypothesis generation; essentials of experimental designs; practical tips and pitfalls during experimental execution; good and bad practices of data collection, analysis and evaluation; form and function of scientific communication; and research ethics. This module will complement and enhance the experience and quality of undergraduate research training.",
