"moduleDescription": "This course focuses on actionable measurement in government, non-profit organizations, social enterprises, philanthropy, and impact investing. \"Actionable\"means that the measurement is used by managers, investors, and other stakeholders in making decisions. The course explores the intersection of three premises that seem to be in some tension with each other. (1) That you can\u2019t manage what you can\u2019t measure, (2) that not everything that counts can be counted, and (3) Campbell\u2019s law that \u201cthe more any quantitative social indicator is used for decision making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor.\"",
