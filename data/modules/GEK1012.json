"moduleDescription": "The module challenges students to examine current and emerging social issues in Singapore that affect family and community well-being. Due to complex social and technological changes that societies are experiencing, people are forced to adapt rapidly, often with negative consequences in many instances. The social issues that arise as a result need to be understood and addressed by individuals, families, communities and society at large. Students will learn to appreciate the implications of these issues for individual and collective action.",
