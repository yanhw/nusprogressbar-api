"moduleDescription": "The proposed module replaces the module EX5104. Population growth and economical development generate large quantities of wastes and also place great pressures on the finite material and energy resources of the earth. Raw materials are bieng used at a faster rate than they are being replaced or available. Therefore, proper management of environmental resources by applying available and emerging environmental technologies in the planning, design and operation activities are important in global resource conservation and in environmental pollution control.",
