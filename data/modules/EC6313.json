"moduleDescription": "This module is designed to train students in advanced econometric applications in various areas. This is a reading-intensive course; students are required to read a large volume of journal articles in the relevant areas and analyse them. Students can make requests to cover topics that are of interest to them. This is an ideal setting for Ph.D. students to try out their thesis research topics. Topics such as Bayesian econometrics, panel regression with unit-root time series, and macroeconometric modelling for forecasting and policy analyses are likely to be covered under this module.",
