"moduleDescription": "Globalisation has made it more important for lawyers to be knowledgeable about the international aspects of litigation. This course focuses on the jurisdictional techniques most relevant to international commercial litigation: in personam jurisdiction, forum non conveniens, interim protective measures, recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments, public policy, and an outline of choice of law issues for commercial contracts. The course, taught from the perspective of Singapore law, based largely on the common law, is designed to give an insight into the world of international litigation. These skills are relevant to not only litigation lawyers, but also lawyers planning international transactions.",
