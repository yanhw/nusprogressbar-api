"moduleDescription": "The rapid process of globalisation over the last decade has had pervasive effects on global shipping and logistics. This could not occur without creating profound impact on the way ports are developed, operated and managed, from providing simple ship shelters and warehouse services to much more complex multimodal terminal services, from monopoly to competition, and from state government-owned to local private corporations. Port Economics taught at graduate level tudies key topics in port management in depth and provides students with analytical and quantitative analysis tools that are essential to research and making decisions related to port operation, management and policy formulation.",
