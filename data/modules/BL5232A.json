"moduleDescription": "Bioimaging is one of the major emerging research areas in biological research due to the wide range of methods available with excellent temporal and spatial resolution. This allows us nowadays to test biological events at the single molecule level. The module aims at introducing the interested student to the practical basis to achieve good images in electron microscopy. Students will perform hands-on experiments on the different microscopes in the Centre of Bioimaging Sciences and will get a basic training to allow them to take images independently.",
