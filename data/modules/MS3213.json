"moduleDescription": "This module seeks to expose students to the thinking of Malay elite on Malay development. In discussing the ideas of the elite, various ideologies and styles of thought would be identified and examined as to their influence on development philosophy. A critique of the thinking of the Malay elite would be attempted. The conditioning of feudalism, colonialism, Islam, nationalism and capitalism on development thinking would be critically analysed. The module is designed for students interested in issues of Malay development and intellectual history.",
