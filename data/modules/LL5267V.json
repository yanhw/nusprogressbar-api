"moduleDescription": "This course introduces students to the fundamentals of how lawyers \u201carchitect\u201d deals. It is taught in three parts. The first examines the unique role of the transactional lawyer and asks the questions: What is a \u201cdeal\u201d? What do transactional or \u201cdeal\u201d lawyers do? How can lawyers successfully design and structure a transaction? The second considers the economic and business considerations that drive the analysis of which legal principles should apply and how risks and benefits are allocated between the parties. It explores on how lawyers \u201ctranslate\u201d such considerations into legal terms within a contractual matrix. The third builds an analytical framework for the assessment of transactions and the choice of contracting constructs and regimes.",
