"moduleDescription": "This is a compulsory module and it introduces students to various fundamental concepts in control system analysis and design. Topics include mathematical modeling of dynamical systems, time responses of first and second-order systems, steady-state error analysis, frequency response analysis of systems and design methodologies based on both time and frequency domains. This module also introduces computer simulation as a means of system evaluation.",
