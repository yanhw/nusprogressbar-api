"moduleDescription": "Pompeii provides us with a vivid glimpse into the economic, political, and cultural life of an ancient Mediterranean city and into that of the Roman Empire at large. The long history of Pompeii closely maps onto the evolution of Rome from an Italian city-state into a cosmopolitan world-empire. In this course, we will discuss the use - and misuse - of literary, documentary, epigraphic, and archaeological evidence in the practice of pre-modern history. We will cover the high and the low, from taverns, brothels and workshops to the business of wealthy merchants, local politicians and members of the imperial family.",
