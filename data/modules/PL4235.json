"moduleDescription": "This module will introduce students to the study of the origins, development, and cognitive processing of morality. The module will cover the history of moral psychology, and the shift from cognitive-developmentalist theories of reasoning-based morality to the current social intuitionist theory of intuition and emotion based morality. The course debates whether morality is innate, intuitive, emotion-driven, reasoned, learned, or a dual process. In doing so, we will explore infants\u2019 and children\u2019s moral development, moral emotions, morality through neuroscience, morality across culture and in politics, and moral dilemmas from philosophical thought experiments.",
