"moduleDescription": "This is a studio-based module, where students from different disciplines work in integrated team to synthesize and implement various sub-systems in the solar house, such as PV-LVDC systems, HVAC and adaptive controls, optimizing hot water and radiant heating. The designing and implementation of each system involves a breadth of considerations and tasks including analyses, simulation, optimization and control strategies, as well as responding to overall architecture intents and constraints such as performance, cost, buildability, site and size constraints. The deliverables of this module is working prototypes, and a written report.",
