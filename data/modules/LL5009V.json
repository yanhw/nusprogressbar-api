"moduleDescription": "This is a skills course conducted entirely in Mandarin and is intended for students who possess a knowledge of basic Chinese. Unfamiliarity with Chinese legal materials and inability to comprehend legal Chinese are common disadvantages faced by Singapore lawyers advising clients who do business in China. This course aims to deal with this. Students are given selected Chinese legal articles, statutes, court judgments and other legal documents and instruments to read and are required to undertake simple practice assignments in Chinese. They are expected to be able to explain Chinese legal concepts in Chinese. Aspects of Chinese legal culture will also be covered in the course.",
