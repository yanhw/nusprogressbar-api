"moduleDescription": "Photography is becoming increasingly important in our interconnected world. The question needs to be asked has the exponential increase in images resulted in a corresponding increase in knowledge or visually literacy? This course will explore the use of photography as a socially conscious art form, representing, reflecting and commenting on society and our place in the world. Learning from the work of photographers of singular importance within the Documentary genre as well as those pushing the boundaries of the medium, students will work towards creating a body of work that tells a story through narrative, emotion, style and substance.",
