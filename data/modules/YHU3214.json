"moduleDescription": "This course investigates central debates in ethics, epistemology and metaphysics within Indian Buddhist thought. It seeks to familiarize students in detail with a single, sophisticated body of thought as that developed over 1,000 years, including debates arising both among Buddhists and between Buddhists and their non-Buddhist critics; to give students conceptual tools and vocabulary for participating in the classical Indian philosophical project; to give students the ability to move between the main areas within philosophy systematically and recognizing the connections between them.",
