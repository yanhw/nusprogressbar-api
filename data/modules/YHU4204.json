"moduleDescription": "Why did Europe rise and China fall? Why did Europe achieve long-term sustained economic growth (the industrial revolution) in the eighteenth century, while China - perhaps the world\u2019s most politically and technologically advanced empire at the time - declined dramatically? Why was Japan the only empire in Asia to catch up with Europe in the nineteenth century? We will attempt to answer these questions by examining the histories of Britain, Europe, China, India and Japan and by reading the major debates in economic history and sociology on the \u2018rise of the west\u2019 and the \u2018great divergence.\u2019",
