"moduleDescription": "This module provides a comparative and evaluative study of Asian cities, highlighting different planning regimes, regulatory processes and institutional environments. The aim is to provide a better understanding of urban planning and how it interacts with economic, social, cultural and political dynamics to shape cities. The module uses a case study and narrative approach, and may include a field study to enhance the appreciation of planning responses to the dynamics of city growth and change at different stages of urban development.",
