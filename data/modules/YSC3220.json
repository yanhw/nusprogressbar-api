"moduleDescription": "Rings and fields are fundamental objects in abstract algebra which arise in a variety of contexts and share meaningful similarities with many familiar number systems. Within a ring or field, one may add, subtract, and multiply, and some familiar axioms hold. This course introduces ring and field theories through a rigorous exploration of polynomial rings, matrix rings, algebraic integers, and finite fields. Factorization will play a central role throughout and major topics will include ideals, quotients, homomorphisms, adjunction, integral domains, unique factorization domains, principal ideal domains, Euclidean domains, and field extensions.",
