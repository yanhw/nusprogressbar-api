"moduleDescription": "Basic Mechanics of Percussion Class A (BMPC-A) is a class in which fundamentals of physical technique are instilled and reinforced. Without proper training of relaxed and consistent shoulder, arm, wrist, hand, and finger control, technical facility will be limited and chances of eventual repetitive strain injury are greatly increased. Additional benefits of the class include improved skills in sound production, use of the metronome, and basic ensemble work.",
