"moduleDescription": "How do we turn science into art? This creative writing module examines how theatre explores issues of science - - the personal, institutional and social dimensions of scientific inquiry \u2013 as students create new original dramatic works. Students read and analyse science plays from a playwright\u2019s perspective, and apply the techniques learned to their own short weekly creative writing exercises based on scientific developments. These will be critiqued by their peers, and will culminate in the research and writing of their own one-act plays.",
