"moduleDescription": "This module aims to introduce relevant topics in total building performance, fire management, specification writing and buildability and their application to design management and development. This module is conducted through two intensive one-week workshops. The first workshop starts right after submission of the Dissertation and deals with Total Building Performance and Fire Management relevant to the early design phase of the Final Design Project. The second workshop is conducted in the first week of S2 and deals with Specification Writing and Buildability, issues more relevant for the advanced stage of the Final Design Project. Through this module, students will become aware of the individual requirements of the above topics and codes. Selected examples will be introduced and students learn how these topics can be applied and that their successful consideration does not compromise on the design.",
