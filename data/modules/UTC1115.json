"moduleDescription": "From the pyramids to the Three Gorges Dam, from nano drug-delivery systems to autonomous robots, the world contains many engineering feats that make you wonder \u201cHow did they do that?\u201d. This module helps students develop basic insights into the workings of selected engineering applications. Coupled to this is an investigation of the engineering marvel \u2018in context\u2019. What problems or issues does it address? What are its costs and consequences \u2013 both intended and unintended? What are the ethical and political dimensions of this? Each run of the module will have a specific thematic focus, such as big structures, biotechnologies, or robotics.",
