"moduleDescription": "This course broadly covers advanced topics in econometrics. The focus is on time series econometrics and financial econometrics. However, panel data and asymptotic theory are also tackled in this course -in more depth than in \u2018Intermediate Econometrics\u2019. This course mixes theory and applied work: theoretical foundations are covered, and the applications of the theory in real life are analysed.",
