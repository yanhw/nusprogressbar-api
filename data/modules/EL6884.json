"moduleDescription": "This advanced seminar provides graduate students with opportunities to undertake and report applied linguistic research in areas of negotiated choice, to develop a situated understanding of applied linguistics as a theoretically informed professional field of enquiry, and to generate spoken and written outcomes that reach, or closely approximate to, internationally publishable standards. Topics may range from critical re-theorising of applied linguistics itself to suitably informed investigations relating to language in action and communicative practices, in such domains as speech therapy, classroom language learning, teaching and assessment, translation, business, legal services, news reporting and broadcasting, and other social and workplace settings.",
