"moduleDescription": "Business projects reinforce CEMS partnership with universities and companies in a unique way of concrete content oriented cooperation. While Academic Advisors and company representatives exchange ideas on the project topic, both sides benefit from the intellectual input - for their research or their business processes, respectively. Within the CEMS Curriculum, Business Projects are designed as real life learning experience for students.
