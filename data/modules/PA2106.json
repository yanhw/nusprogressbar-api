"moduleDescription": "This is the first Pharmacology module for Pharmacy Professional Course. This module will introduce Pharmacology, the scientific study of the actions of drugs and chemicals in living systems and provide the general principles and concepts of pharmacokinetics (body\u2019s handling of drug) and pharmacodynamics (principles/mechanism of drug action) in humans. A sound understanding of these foundation principles, which constitute the scientific basis of therapeutics, will promote the safe and rational use of drugs in disease conditions. The module will then progress to the study of the pharmacological properties of various classes of clinically useful drugs.",
