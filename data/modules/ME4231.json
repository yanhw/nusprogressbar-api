"moduleDescription": "This module introduces students the basic concepts/theories/applications in aerodynamics and propulsion. Major topics are: Characteristics and parameters for airfoil and wing aerodynamics; Incompressible flow past thin airfoils and finite-span wings; Aerodynamic design considerations; Compressible subsonic, transonic and supersonic flows past airfoils and supersonic flow past finite-span wings; Propulsion. The module is targeted at students who are interested in aerodynamics, especially those who intend to work in the aviation industry or those who intend to do R&D work in the aerodynamics area.",
