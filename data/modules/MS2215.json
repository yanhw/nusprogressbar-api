It offers insights into the works of both indigenous and foreign writers, scrutinizing each of these writings against wider developments in scholarship and politics of their time. The module covers different genres of historical writings including among others, the Hikayat and Babad tradition, Orientalist works, Malay autobiographical works, nationalist writings, social scientific historiography, postmodern historiography and popular historiography with the aim of evaluating the usefulness of each of these approaches.",
