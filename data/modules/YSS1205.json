"moduleDescription": "Game theory studies strategic situations where the involved parties impact each other\u2019s welfare through their individual decisions. In such situations, it becomes necessary to think about how others will act while trying to further one\u2019s own goals. Game theory has wide ranging applications and is used to model strategic interactions in both human and biological worlds. This course introduces students to concepts in game theory and their applications.",
