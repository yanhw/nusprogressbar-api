"moduleDescription": "This module provides the foundation for a more advanced level control systems course. Topics include system description, controllability, observability, selection of pole locations for good design, observer design, full-order and reduced-order observers, combined control law and observer. It is also a first course in nonlinear systems and control. Topics include non-linearities in control systems, use of root-locus in analysis of non-linear systems, describing function and its use in analysis and design of control systems, non-linear ordinary differential equations, singular points, and phase-plane analysis.",
