"moduleDescription": "This module has three primary foci: (1) the nature of religions as historically and geographically situated social practice, (2) an introduction to select historically significant/influential theories of religion and influences of these theories within Anthropology and Sociology, and (3) exposing students to contemporary sociological/anthropological research on selected religions/religious practices, which may include Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Taoism and Buddhism. Students will apply social science research methodologies to their own explorations of social practices of religion within the context of Singapore. These research opportunities are designed to have students explore religious practices other than their own and those of their ancestors.",
