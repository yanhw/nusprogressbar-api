It covers the fundamental discounted cash flow models for underwriting across different types of properties. The concept of leverage is also introduced in relation to cash flow projections. Specific techniques include developing cash flow proformas, ratio analyses and capitalization rate and establishing discount rates for handling risk using the CAPM or alternative models.",
