"moduleDescription": "This module introduces fuel options for mankind beyond coal, conventional natural gas and petroleum. It is a multidisciplinary course integrating cutting edge technologies for the utilization of future fossil fuels (such as shale gas, coal bed methane and methane hydrates), biofuels and hydrogen fuel. Students will learn various types of alternative fuels, their advantages, significance, current practise, production strategies, and challenges ahead. A term project along with several real and literature case studies from key areas will be used to illustrate and reinforce the learning. This module is meant for graduate students having chemical engineering background.",
