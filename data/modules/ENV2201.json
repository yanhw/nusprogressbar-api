"moduleDescription": "Southeast Asia is noted for its rich biodiversity. The region is also noted for its rapid economic growth and development, which threaten this biodiversity. Wildlife protection has to withstand the challenges of diminishing habitats, the hunting of targeted species, and the illegal trade of wildlife & its derivative products. This course explores how Singapore and another Southeast Asian country (e.g., Vietnam), are addressing these challenges. It examines the variety of protection instruments (nature reserves, species conservation), the legal and policy framework (national & international), and the perceptions and attitudes of societies toward wildlife.",
