The topic for directed research must not have been studied in another course. Students may not do a research paper on a topic if they have previously done a research assignment on that topic for another course. Students interested in doing Directed Research are advised to seek the provisional approval of their proposed supervisor before opting for the subject. Copies of the Directed Research Guidelines are available from the Dean's office or on the Faculty Home Page http://law.nus.edu.sg/ug/dr/index.htm",
