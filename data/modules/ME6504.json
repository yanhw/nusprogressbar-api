"moduleDescription": "The module deals with defects and dislocations in solids, with emphasis on physical understanding of the geometry and arrangement of dislocations. Basic features of the geometry, movement and elastic properties of dislocations are first described. Properties of dislocations associated with their movement, intersections with other dislocations, jogs and multiplication of dislocations will be considered. Effects of defects and dislocations on properties will also be discussed. The main topics include fundamentals of crystallography, types of defects in solids, thermodynamics of defects, dislocations and strength of crystalline solids. The course is suitable for engineering and science graduate students.",
