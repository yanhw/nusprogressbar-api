It will explore the economic, social, migratory, state-formation, diplomatic and environmental issues leading to the formation and growth of Singapore as a port-state in the 14th century. While the course will look at the narratives and arguments around the historical narrative of that period, it will also have a substantial methods component that will include textual materials, archaeometry and archaeology.",
