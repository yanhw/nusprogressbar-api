"moduleDescription": "This course will explore the ways in which seemingly nonpolitical everyday practices bear, or can come to have, ethical and political significance. We will look at philosophers and political theorists concerned with the ordinary activities of Speaking, Eating, Thinking and Walking, and how such activities reveal or inform, among other things, our concepts of responsibility, the human and the animal, the moral and political necessity of selfreflection, and the interactions between the individual and the natural and built environment. Thinkers to be read include Arendt, Austin, Benjamin, Cavell, Diamond, Singer, Thoreau, Rousseau and others.",
