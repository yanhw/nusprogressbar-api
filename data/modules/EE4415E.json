"moduleDescription": "This module introduces the students to the design of integrated circuits. It covers basic concepts including integrated circuits fabrication technology, CMOS and nMOS design, inverter design, aspect ratios of pull-up and pull-down transistors, switching characteristics of CMOS and nMOS inverters, latch-up, stick diagram, design rules, mask layout, sub-systems design, ASIC challenges and issues, ASIC design flow, Verilog hardware design language basics, and logic synthesis. Each student will do a design exercise using the EDA tools.",
