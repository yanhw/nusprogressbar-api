"moduleDescription": "This elective module involves an individual programme of study undertaken in conjunction with an overseas university with which NUS has a signed collaborative agreement. Students will be expected to use the visit to the overseas host institution to build networks and ascertain similarities and differences in health care practices, models of service delivery, and policies between Singapore and the host country. The minimum placement will be two consecutive weeks. On return to Singapore students will present an oral seminar on outcomes of the visit and write a 2000 word critical review of key issues.",
