"moduleDescription": "Can a row of bricks be art? Can pouring water from a pitcher be an artwork? Would walking back and forth be a 'dance'? This course is an introduction to 1960s art in the U.S.A. - Pop Art and more. It focuses on art in New York City, and an important figure whose influence is still evident today: the experimental composer John Cage. This course uses Cage's ideas to consider how 1960s art (Pop, Minimalist sculpture, and new performance) profoundly changed the way we think about what an artist is, what an artwork might do, and the role of the audience.",
