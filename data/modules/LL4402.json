"moduleDescription": "Insolvency law is relevant to virtually all aspects of commercial activity involving the provision of credit. This course will explore its key concepts in the context of a winding up u the moratorium, powers of recovery, the pari passu principle, the external manager, avoidance of transactions, proof of debts and set-off. We will then review receivership, judicial management and schemes of arrangement as alternative procedures to the liquidation of a company in a winding up. We conclude with a brief examination of informal debt restructurings. This course will be taught principally through seminars for which prior preparation and participation are required.",
