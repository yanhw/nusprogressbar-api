"moduleDescription": "This module offers students theoretical and applied understandings of mobilities as a productive site of social life and culture. Drawing perspectives from the \u2018new\u2019 mobilities paradigm, it demonstrates how movement is not a sterile activity or zone, but a space replete with meaning. To exemplify this point, this course takes transportation as a lens of analysis, and interrogates its socio-cultural organization and experience. Three aspects will be emphasized, namely the identities and embodiments latent in transportation; the infrastructures of transit; and the (geo)politics of mobility. Case studies will be drawn internationally, including Asia.",
