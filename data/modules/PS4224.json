It focuses on the relationship between civil society and the state and on the institutions and processes that mediate that relationship. Topics covered include contemporary theories of the modern state; political culture and civil society; revolutionary and non-revolutionary political regime change; clientelism; and corporatist and non-corporatist forms of interest group intermediation.",
