"moduleDescription": "This course is an introduction to contemporary Chinese politics. After a survey on China's political culture and tradition, the rise of modern China and Chinese Communism, it discusses a range of nation-building issues in the People's Republic of China. These include the role of ideology, developmental strategies, political institutions, and state-society relations. Having examined the domestic political issues, the course proceeds to analyse Chinese foreign policy. Topics to be dealt with include China's relations with the U.S., Japan, Russia, European Union, and ASEAN. The problems related to the reunification of mainland China and Taiwan are also covered.",
