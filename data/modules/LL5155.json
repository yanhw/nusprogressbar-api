"moduleDescription": "This seminar will explore several key topics at the intersection of law and economics. It will commence with an exploration of the concept of rationality as employed in (positive) micro-economic theory. It will also explore the Coase theorem as a means of understanding the importance of legal rules and institutions. These theoretical tools will then be used as a lens for examining, amongst other topics, tort, contract and insolvency law; company law; financial regulation, and the role of law and legal institutions in economic development.",
