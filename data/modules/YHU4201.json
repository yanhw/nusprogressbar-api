"moduleDescription": "In classical logic, every sentence is either true or false, every argument with contradictory premises or a tautologous conclusion is valid, and every conditional with a false antecedent or true consequent is true. In this course, we explore non-classical logics which weaken these assumptions, including but not limited to various many-valued, modal and relevant logics, along with the philosophical questions they raise and answer",
