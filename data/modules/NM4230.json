"moduleDescription": "This module will discuss the foundation of participatory communication by challenging the modernization paradigm and the traditional communication approaches for social change that have been widely used by government agencies and for-profit and non-profit organizations. Examples include social marketing, behaviour change models, and entertainment education. This module aims to provide an overview of critical theories and to critically examine the role of collective learning, information sharing, public participation, and dialogue in designing, implementing, and evaluating communication strategies for social change. Students will have the opportunity to apply the participatory communication approach to conducting community-based projects and assessing its social impact.",
