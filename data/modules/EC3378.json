"moduleDescription": "India is one of Asia\u2019s most important economies and amongst the largest in the world. However, India\u2019s, and South Asia\u2019s trade/investment integration with the rest of Asia remains limited. With business-friendly government firmly in power in India, the module will focus on applied aspects of the macroeconomic fundamentals, and growth strategies in India and South Asian economies, and their cross-border thematic issues with policy relevance (e.g. demographic dividend, overcoming poverty, income inequality, knowledge economy, R&D/innovation, environmental challenges, governance issues, etc). The module will also deal with the ongoing and planned intra-regional, and interregional cooperation measures (eg. SAARC, SAFTA, SASEC, ASEAN, RCEP, GMS, BRICS\u2019 NDB, etc).",
