"moduleDescription": "This topic-based module develops quantitative reasoning skills through a structured analysis of an important but accessible problem, imparting to students the appreciation that, for many questions/issues, a quantitative analysis can provide the insight and clarity that complements and moves beyond what might be gained through a qualitative approach. This module looks at environmental quality and human health. Students will learn how environmental quality is measured, air and water quality parameters, and health effects of pollution. They will apply quantitative analyses in understanding our environment and its link to our wellbeing.",
