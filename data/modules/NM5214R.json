"moduleDescription": "The module aims to connect philosophy and design, STS (Science Technology Society studies) and HCI (Human Computer Interaction). STS can improve our design practices vis-\u00e0-vis ecological, economic and political crises by bringing a different understanding of the stakeholders\u2019 perspectives and provide a more informed discussion about the possibilities and the limits we face in our complex society. Design practices, on the other hand, provide a much needed experimental method and framework for humanities and social sciences to understand the conceptual conundrum of actor-networks, various ideas of flows, spheres, agency and materiality.",
