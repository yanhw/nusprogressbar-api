"moduleDescription": "The Governance Study Project (GSP) is a year-long team- based project. Consisting of a study trip at the end of the first semester, a seminar, and a final conference the end of the special term, the GSP connects the beginning to the end of the degree programme, requiring students to put to use the knowledge and skills learnt in each module. Through projects that are real public problems, students will acquire skills related to analysis of complex managerial problems, basic research, and writing and other presentational modes. The GSP also aims to develop team building and a strong sense of cohort.",
