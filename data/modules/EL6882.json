Students are expected to identify for themselves key issues pertaining to the relationship between language and society. Among the possible topics discussed are: critical comparisons between autonomous and socially-oriented views of language; differences between variationist sociolinguistics and more critically-informed approaches; the relationship between linguistic structure, language ideology and power.",
