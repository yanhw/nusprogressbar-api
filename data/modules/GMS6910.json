"moduleDescription": "This module will provide theory and practical exercises in methods of evolutionary genetic analysis including, multiple sequence alignment, evolutionary models, phylogenetic tree reconstruction, temporal phylogenetics, natural selection, population dynamics, and experimental design and hypothesis testing. The module is directed towards graduate students with basic cell biology, microbiology, and immunology background. In addition to theory the students will gain extensive experience in the use of computer programs used in evolutionary analysis.",
