"moduleDescription": "This module considers cultural production as an arena of contestation for voice and visibility. It explores how creative performances and productions have been used to express, subvert, or redefine social realities and values, constitute publics, and initiate change. A variety of forms, such as street theatres, music, cartoons, community and online media, will be explored through an anthropological engagement with the everyday politics of recognition, narration, belonging, and indeed the valuation of one\u2019s voice. Power, performance, agency, creativity, audiences, art worlds and aesthetics are among the key concepts explored.",
