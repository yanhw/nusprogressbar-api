"moduleDescription": "Among the themes covered are state power and formation, ideology, political violence and terror, democracy/authoritarianism, and social movements. These are addressed in relation to issues of political economy transformations within societies as well as the changing international political economy. It asks a number of fundamental questions, including: What are some of the defining features of social conflict and of the exercise of power in modern societies? What is the role of the state and of civil society-based organisations in defining social, political, and economic trajectories? Are major social transformations inevitably accompanied by conflict and violence? Has the nature of social conflict and power, domestic and international, been transformed in the post-Cold War and post-9/11 International Order? How has the recent world economic crisis affected the kinds of social conflicts that transpire in the developed and developing worlds? This module is comparative, providing case studies from the experiences of contemporary European, Latin American and Asian societies.",
