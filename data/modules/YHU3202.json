"moduleDescription": "Reading theories of hybridity, postcoloniality, and difference, we will explore the musical results of cultural interaction in various locations/periods. Themes of appropriation, representation, globalization, and identity will be explored and students will engage in critiquing and developing their own theories of musical hybridity/cultural interaction. Case studies may include: Appalachian Bluegrass \u2013 backwoods to hipster; South Asian Bhangra and diasporic identity; Mariachi and male/Mexican identity; Indonesian nationalism and Kroncong; Singaporean Chinese orchestra, Getai, and nonmainland Chinese identities; Malay Mak Yong revival in Singapore; reconstructions and rediscoveries of (hybrid) authenticity in the form of Irish/Celtic music and Yo-yo Ma\u2019s Silk Road Project.",
