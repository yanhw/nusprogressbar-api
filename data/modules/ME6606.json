This course will focus on the early (conceptual) stages of design and development of mainly mechanical products, looking at the technologies available to convert new ideas into a manufactured reality. Emphasis will be on the practical implications, constraints and in-depth analysis, with an integrated assignment that encourages student groups to investigate the technologies for generation of a product.",
