"moduleDescription": "This foundation module aims to introduce students to the fundamental concepts and underlying principles of systems, and systems thinking and design. The modelling approaches and tools that are applicable to the design of industrial and service systems will be introduced. The topics in this module include introduction to systems, systems thinking concepts, mental models and causal loop diagrams, while the modelling approaches and tools to be covered include those of systems analysis and data analysis. The application of these topics to simple systems design problems will be illustrated through laboratory sessions. Real-world case studies will be presented to show how these concepts have been applied in industrial and service contexts.",
