"moduleDescription": "This course takes a problem-oriented approach to public international law. Its primary objective is to provide students with an understanding of the basic principles of public international law and a framework for analysing international legal disputes. The focus will be a past problem from the Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition. This will be used to illustrate the basic principles of public international law applicable in an international dispute. Its second objective is to teach students how to research points of international law and to construct persuasive arguments based on legal precedent, general principles, policy and facts.",
