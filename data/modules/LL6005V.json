"moduleDescription": "Bank Documentation is an advanced contract course situated in the banking context. Students will be introduced to key principles that govern banking transactions as well as a variety of contractual clauses used by banks in their standard-form documentation. The aim of the course is to promote an understanding of these terms, how they operate and their shortcomings. Some emphasis is placed on contractual techniques used by banks to maintain control over their contractual relationships and to allocate risk, as well as the common law and statutory limits on their effectiveness. Students are required to evaluate the fairness of typical banking terms by applying relevant law and guidelines. Those who successfully complete the module will be equipped to navigate their way around standard form agreements (banking as well as others), recognize and understand the operation of a range of contractual terms, and predict their effectiveness.",
