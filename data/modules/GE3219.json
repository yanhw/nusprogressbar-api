"moduleDescription": "This module aims to provide students with an in-depth understanding of the social, political, and economic changes at various geographical scales with respect to globalisation. More specifically, this module focuses on developing understandings of the complex forces driving globalisation and the related urban and regional changes and the relationship between globalisation and regionalisation. This module is not just for geography students, but for all students who are interested in the urban and regional changes in the Asia-Pacific with respect to globalisation and regionalisation and the driving forces of the changes.",
