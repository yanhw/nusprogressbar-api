"moduleDescription": "The module provides the initial understanding of model making for industrial design. Model making techniques related to metals, wood, and plastics will be undertaken. Safety and security issues will also be addressed. Students are required to do model making exercises to develop different skills as part of the design process. This module is to support the design core modules in order to provide sufficient practical basis for their future design projects.",
