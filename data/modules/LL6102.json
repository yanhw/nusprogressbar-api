"moduleDescription": "Advanced Torts is designed to build on and further your knowledge of tort law. The course is divided into two parts. In Part One, we will examine some fundamental concepts and debates surrounding tort law. The objective is to understand what is distinctive about torts and how torts are important in a civilised system of law. In Part Two, we will examine torts not already covered in the first year course. This will include consideration of important torts such as defamation, conversion, deceit, conspiracy and breach of statutory duty. These torts will be examined by reference to the best of the literature and by a selection of representative cases.",
