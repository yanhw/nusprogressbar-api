"moduleDescription": "Southeast Asians have been fascinated with the idea of death and dying for centuries. In fact, almost all Southeast Asian cultures and communities have developed highly intricate and complex ideas, ceremonies and rituals for all activities associated with death and dying. This module enables students to understand and demystify the topic of death and dying in Southeast Asia from a multidisciplinary perspective. It looks into how various communities, medical institutions, commercial enterprises and religious groups in the region cope and understand death and dying in order to further understand Southeast Asia, one of the most complex regions in the world.",
