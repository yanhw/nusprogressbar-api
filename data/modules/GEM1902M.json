"moduleDescription": "This seminar attempts to explore the relationality between seeing and knowledge. It begins with a meditation on the phrase \u201cseeing is believing\u201d; and questions the privileging of sight over all the other senses. Through a close reading of various texts, seminar participants will explore the relationality between sight and blindness\u2014are they necessarily antonyms, or are they always already a part of each other? And if they are intimately related, what are the implications on knowledge? Are we all potentially blind to our own insights?",
