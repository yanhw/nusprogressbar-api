It examines the ways in which the Japanese and Chinese nations have interacted with each other from the mid-19th century to the present. Students learn how both a sense of cultural affinity as well as a deep-seated mistrust have shaped relations between the two powers. This module also examines the transformation of the Sino-Japanese political and economic relationship in a changing international environment.",
