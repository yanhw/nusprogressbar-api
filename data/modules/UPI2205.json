"moduleDescription": "The environmental crisis, manifested in air and water pollution, environmental degradation, the rate of extinction of animal and plant species, and the depletion of natural resources, has many different aspects, the most important being, arguably, the philosophical aspect. In this module, students will be introduced to the philosophical debate about environmental issues. The objective is to equip students with concepts and theories that will help them think about the environment at the fundamental level. Major topics include anthropocentrism and non-anthropocentrism, bio-centred ethics, deep ecology, eco-feminism and environmental virtues.",
