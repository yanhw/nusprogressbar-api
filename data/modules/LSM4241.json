"moduleDescription": "This module aims to introduce selected topics on functional genomics. Areas covered include : the assignment of functions to novel genes following from the genome-sequencing projects of human and other organisms; the principles underlying enabling technologies: DNA microarrays, proteomics, protein chips, structural genomics, yeast two-hybrid system, transgenics, and aspects of bioinformatics and its applications; and to understand the impact of functional genomics on the study of diseases such as cancer, drug discovery, pharmacogenetics and healthcare.",
