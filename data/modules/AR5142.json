"moduleDescription": "The Dissertation is intended to evaluate the students ability to carry out independent research in technical design issues and systems relevant to building and architectural design. The student is expected to identify a significant problem in any of the following areas: detailing for weathering performance, reduction in assembly and construction time and cost, detailing for energy efficiency, material limits and potentials in built application. The study will be based on precedent studies before proposing original solutions to identified problems related to constructional/ engineering performance issues. The dissertation is to include analytical and assembly drawings not exceeding 8000 words. Alternatively, the dissertation may involve technical experimentation (digitally or laboratory) based or involving fieldwork, to verify technical findings.",
