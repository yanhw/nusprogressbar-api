"moduleDescription": "This course addresses the interactions between surface processes and landforms and landscapes. These interactions lead to physical, chemical and biological changes, which in turn create the current landscapes and the geological record of past landscapes. This focus is core to both physical geographical and geological communities, and also the wider geosciences.",
