"moduleDescription": "A UROP involves the student working with a supervisor, and sometimes in a team, on an existing research project. A CAPT UROP may focus on research related to a particular aspect of life, education or organization at the College. Alternatively, students may participate in research led by a College Fellow or other academic, as long as the project gives the student exposure to forms of expertise and/or interests that go beyond any particular discipline. The aim of the UROP is to help support a student\u2019s academic and professional development through a meaningful research apprenticeship. The UROP is a graded module.",
