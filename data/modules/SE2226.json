"moduleDescription": "This module introduces undergraduates to the culture and history of the Muslim ethnic minority groups collectively known as the Moro peoples of the Philippines. The syllabus exposes students to a variety of perspectives on Moro peoples \u2013 including but not limited to history, culture, politics, economics, identity, literature, and religion. It explores insights of both indigenous writers and foreign observers, scrutinizing each of these writings against wider developments in the scholarship and politics of Moro identity and, to a limited extent, Islam in the Philippines and Malay Studies. The module covers different aspects of Moro life in the past and the present.",
