"moduleDescription": "In an era of globalization marked by a dramatic increase in cross-border interactions and transactions, the legal norms regulating these cross-border phenomena \u2013 from terrorism to environmental protection to business law \u2013 and disputes arising from them are complex and uneven. This rise in transnational legality poses a challenge for the modern concept of law and for state and inter-state law as traditionally conceived. This course traces the emergence of the state and considers how state law has been shaped by and has adapted to globalization. It examines legal and non-legal responses to transnational problems, using examples from several areas of law.",
