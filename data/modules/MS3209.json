To answer these questions we will discuss the Malays in the socio-economic and political context they live in. The module is divided into five topics: Topic 1 looks at the socio-history of the Malays. Topic 2 introduces approaches in studying Malays of Singapore. Topics 3, 4 and 5 look at different dimensions of their life in Singapore i.e. as Singapore citizens, as part of the Malay &quot;community&quot; and as members of &quot;Malay families&quot;.",
