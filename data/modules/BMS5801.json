The module will discuss pertinent management communication principles, concepts and strategies and provide opportunities for their application in hands-on tasks and assignments in an immersive experience within a company simulated environment, where critical high-stakes communication is weaved into more routine day-to-day workplace communication, mimicking the situations managers encounter in real-life.",
