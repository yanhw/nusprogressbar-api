"moduleDescription": "This module introduces the students to the basic elements for design of medical devices through a hands-on design project performed in teams. Examples of engineering analysis and design are applied to representative topics in bioengineering, such as biomechanics, bioinstrumentation, biomaterials, biotechnology, and related areas. Topics include: identification of the technological needs, design methodology, evaluation of costs and benefits, quality of life and ethical considerations.",
