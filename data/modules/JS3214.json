Some famous studies of the Japanese self by psychologists, anthropologists, sociologists and socio-linguists will be discussed, supplemented by a historical perspective focusing on the samurai heritage and the ideas behind the Meiji Restoration. No knowledge of the Japanese language or of specialised scholarly vocabulary is required or expected.",
