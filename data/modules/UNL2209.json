"moduleDescription": "Can physics allow us to know the reality of nature or does it merely tell us how nature appears? Or for that matter, what are the limits of knowledge in physics, constrained as it is to giving responsible proof for the claims it makes? This module explores some of the developments of quantum physics and how they bear on the philosophical notions of reality and appearances. The enquiry here will consist of an in-depth examination of the theoretical and experimental observations that claim to elucidate the notion of realism. Students will be taken through a journey that showcases the developments that have shaped our current views on the topic.",
