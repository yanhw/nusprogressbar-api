"moduleDescription": "The aim of this module is for students to understand and assess the social policies in Singapore, especially those concerning welfare services for vulnerable groups. They will learn to do so in the international historical and theoretical context of the welfare state and welfare pluralism, and contemporary international discourses on social well-being and human development. Review of social policy and welfare services in Singapore will focus upon the Singapore\u2019s unique approaches to policy formulation, implementation and monitoring. Welfare services for the vulnerable groups will be assessed within the larger context of social well-being and development.",
