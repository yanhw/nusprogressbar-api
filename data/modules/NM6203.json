"moduleDescription": "Using examples of culturally-centered projects of social change globally, this module provides a starting point to engage in theorizing, methodological development, and designing of applications in the context of the culture-centered approach to communication for social change. Blending theory and practice, the module encourages thoughtful criticism of existing policy and program formulations and explores the communicative processes through which the margins may be centered in processes of communication. The problems of inequality and inaccess are examined through the lens of a cultural critique and subsequent interventions are studied both at macro and micro levels utilizing critical social science principles.",
