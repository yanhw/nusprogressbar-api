"moduleDescription": "This module examines the role of South Asia in the world economy. The analysis will be conducted at two levels. The first is how the region as a whole interacts with other regional organizations such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and multilateral institutions such as the Asian Development Bank, The World Bank, and the World Trade Organization. The second level concerns external economic linkages and relations of selected individual South Asian countries.",
