"moduleDescription": "linear system theory is the core of modern control appropaches, such as optimal, robust, adaptive and multi-variable control. This module develops a solid understanding of the fundamentals of linear systems analysis and design using the state space approach. Topics covered include state space representation of systems; solution of state equations; stability analysis using Lyapunov methods; controllability and observability; linear state feedback design; asymptotic observer and compensator design, decoupling and servo control. This module is a must for higher degree students in control engineering, robotics or servo engineering. It is also very useful for those who are interested in signal processing and computer engineering.",
