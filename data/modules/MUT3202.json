"moduleDescription": "This module is designed for students who wish to further explore the depth and diversity of the most complex of all tonal forms: sonata. After reviewing its historical predecessors (binary and ternary forms), formal principles, and terminology, it will investigate various sonata movements from different genres (solo sonata, chamber and orchestral music, vocal music) in chronical order, following their development and enlargement. Other topics include: sonata-rondo, sonata movement in concerto, single-movement sonata (Liszt, Schoenberg), and posttonal sonata (Bart\u00f3k, Boulez). Students will work on the individual analysis of a sonata in their current repertoire.",
