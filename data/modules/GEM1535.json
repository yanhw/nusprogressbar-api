"moduleDescription": "Modern civilization, which on the one hand boasts of having discovered the behaviour of subatomic particles, has also to its credit the impending intensified energy crisis and global warming. The urgent need to address these challenges has now become obvious. The course will acquaint students with the role of scientific development towards understanding the current global energy crisis and global warming. Emphasis will be given on how scientific progress has helped us in understanding the principle and development of various clean energy and storage technologies, their potential and applicability in present day scenarios and in shaping future energy systems.",
