"moduleDescription": "This module will explore the changes that occur in animal cells as they grow, mature, differentiate, and either senesce or renew themselves. Insights into the mechanisms that govern how and when particular developmental alterations occur will be discussed. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the cellular molecular mechanisms that lend themselves to experimental manipulation.",
