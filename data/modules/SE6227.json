"moduleDescription": "This module explores ways of understanding the specificities and social realities of thought, action, and cultural subjectivities in Southeast Asia and how postcolonial approaches offer some answers but also pose further questions to the project of understanding local difference in Southeast Asia. It offers an introduction to major controversies in the study of local difference in Southeast Asia and explores their linkages as well as challenges to postcolonial premises, analytical concepts, and critical procedures.",
