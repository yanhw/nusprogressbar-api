"moduleDescription": "This module is conducted as a graduate seminar and examines important contributions to social work theory from classical as well as modernist perspectives with a view to encouraging deeper reflection about the critical interface between theory and practice. Students are challenged to examine social work practice issues alongside the discourse on social structure and human agency and are expected to make presentations to demonstrate a heightened awareness of modern ideological currents that shape social work practice.",
