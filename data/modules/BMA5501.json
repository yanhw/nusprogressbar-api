Students are introduced to both the Art and the Science of \"Strategic Thinking\"in devising competitive strategies. This course aims to: 1. enhance student's ability to think and to act strategically in marketing, 2. provide students some decision heuristics based on Sun Tzu's \"Art of War\"to assist them in making marketing strategy decisions, 3. introduce students to some fundamental Game Theoretic tools and models for analysing and understanding problems involving strategic interactions, and 4. introduce students to some advanced strategy concepts and theories. Students are expected to apply both the Art and Science of strategy learnt to solving marketing problems, through case analyses, critiques, and presentations. There will also be a case research project requirement, which requires students to identify and analyse an actual marketing problem or case, and to make recommendations as to how the problem can be resolved, based on concepts taught in class.",
