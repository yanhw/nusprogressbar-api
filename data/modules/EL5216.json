"moduleDescription": "This module takes an empirical approach to linguistic investigation: it bases claims on adequate electronic language datasets known as corpora. Such corpora may either be stand-alone or drawn from the World Wide Web, the dynamic mega-corpus. With special reference to English, relevant topics will be introduced to suit particular needs and may include the relation between corpora and lexicography, culture studies, translation, language teaching and computer-mediated communication. Participants will also receive hands-on training with stand-alone linguistic programmes and those found on the World Wide Web. This module does not assume any expert computing knowledge.",
