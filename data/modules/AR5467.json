"moduleDescription": "Despite Modern Architecture\u2019s emphasis on housing, the domestic realm (its interiority, experience and occupancy) is often a neglected area of study since attention is focused on housing as a large-scale urban form. Yet, domestic spaces embed important issues of gender, class, taste, ethnicity, family filial ties ('filiality') and identity. This interdisciplinary module explores the concept of domesticity \u2013 how and where we live \u2013 by examining its portrayals in architecture, art and film. It gives a broad and critical overview by working through a series of key contemporary architectural, art and film projects drawn from Asia, Europe and the United States.",
