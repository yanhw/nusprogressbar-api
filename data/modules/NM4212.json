"moduleDescription": "This module examines a set of key issues in connection with the understanding and analysis of representations of family, class, gender, ethnicity, politics, national identity, citizenship and technology from the broad perspective of new media studies. It explores the idea of representation from various angles, notably through contemporary cultural, post-colonial, feminist, and social semiotic theories and frameworks. The course aims to provide students the necessary practical knowledge and skills required for engaging in theoretically informed media analysis and commentaries. The module will use diverse materials such as various genres of (online) texts, images, cartoons, and films for hands-on exercises to attain this objective.",
