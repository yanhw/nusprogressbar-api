"moduleDescription": "This course provides students with the experience of programming devices and computer interfaces. The course builds upon the C language programming skills the students have learnt in the previous semester and teaches them how to utilize programming to build simple digital systems. The course culminates in an open-ended project in which students will have the opportunity to design and build a digital system of their choice.",
