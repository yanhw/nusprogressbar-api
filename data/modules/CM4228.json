"moduleDescription": "This module covers the principles and characteristics of heterogeneous, homogeneous and enzymatic catalysis. Reaction cycles are analysed at the molecular level, and a microkinetic approach is used to describe the processes. Selected industrial processes and commercial devices are discussed to illustrate practical applications of the studied topics.",
