First, the vision of agriculture found in early development thought; second the structural transformations of agriculture in the twentieth century in terms of production and trade; third, an examination of states that have resisted the globalising tide in order to determine whether their domestic policies qualify as \u201cdevelopment\u201d; and finally the possibility of decoupling development and globalisation.",
