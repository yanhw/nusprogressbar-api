"moduleDescription": "This module is intended to provide research students with necessary knowledge and skills on how to carry out real estate research. The module includes two parts. First, students will be taught the mechanics and process of research like reviewing literature, defining research questions, designing research methodology, analyzing research findings, and writing academic papers. It hopes to provide students with adequate knowledge to differentiate good research from a bad one. Statistical techniques will be introduced in the second half of the module. The emphasis, however, is on the application of the statistical tools to real estate research questions. As part of the module to get students to apply relevant statistical tools, instruction and hands-on practice on some sophisticated softwares will also be included.
