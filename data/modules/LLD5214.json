"moduleDescription": "The module explores principles and rules relating to the exploration for, development and production of oil and gas (upstream operations). The main focus of the module is on the examination of different arrangements governing the legal relationship between states and international oil companies, such as modern concessions, productionsharing agreements, joint ventures, service and hybrid contracts. The agreements governing the relationships between companies involved in upstream petroleum operations (joint operating and unitisation agreements) will also be examined. The module will further explore the issues of dispute settlement, expropriation, stability of contracts and a relevant international institutional and legal framework.",
