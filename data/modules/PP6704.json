"moduleDescription": "This module aims to provide economic perspectives on selected features of economic systems, and on design, implementation, and outcomes of various public policy issues. The first part of the course covers broad areas such as the nature of market systems and capitalism, the economic boundaries of the State, and economics of globalization. The second part of the module focuses on selected public policy themes (such as, inequalities) and issues such as social security, health, education, state enterprise reform, taxes and subsidies, and environment. The module emphasizes that while economic principles are universal, their application must be contextual and capability-driven.",
