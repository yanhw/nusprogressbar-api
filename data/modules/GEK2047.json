This course explores Chinese-language film history from the 1930s to the present through examining some key genres of films made by major filmmakers from China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, including opera, musical, action and youth films. Special attention will be paid to the socio-cultural condition of their production, distribution, exhibition and consumption, as well as larger regional cultural connections of these four places.
