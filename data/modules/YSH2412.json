"moduleDescription": "A predominant pattern in Western epics has been the \u201dNovel of Formation\u201d (Bildungsroman) \u2013 the novel that follows an individual through the stages of her life. The last century has seen a radical reversal. Instead of narrating a life\u2019s development, the new novel concentrates on the institution that shapes individuals and renders them subjects (school, bureaucracy, court of law etc.). The German-Czech writer Kafka is the master of the new genre. The course highlights Kafka\u2019s \u201cThe Trial\u201d as a \u201cnovel of institution\u201d while drawing on related works including \u201cThe Castle,\u201d and exploring concepts such as \u201cinstitution,\u201d \u201cnovel,\u201d \u201cform of life.\u201d",
