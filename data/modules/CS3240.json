"moduleDescription": "This course is intended for students in computing and related disciplines whose work focuses on human-computer interaction issues in the design of computer systems. The course stresses the importance of user-centred design and usability in the development of computer applications and systems. Students will be taken through the analysis, design, development, and evaluation of human-computer interaction methods for computer systems. They will acquire hands-on design skills through laboratory exercises and assignments. The course also covers HCI design principles and emphasizes the importance of contextual, organisational, and social factors in system design.",
