"moduleDescription": "This module looks at gender relations of Malay women and men in different socio-cultural and institutional contexts in Malay societies. The focus is on social constructions and re-production of Malay femininities and masculinities. Students will be provided with a theoretical framework to examine issues concerning Malay women and men including how Malay women and men are represented in literature and media as well as contestations with regards to womans and mans roles in development projects, family and in the work place. Students will also explore the contributions of experiences of Malay women and men to academic discourses on gender relations.",
