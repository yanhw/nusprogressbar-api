"moduleDescription": "Students will be expected to learn how to devise a feasible, policy relevant, research question, and to address they question using statistical methods. They will undertake a literature review of the topic and find an appropriate data set. They will formulate a theory and devise and method of estimation and hypothesis test for their question and undertake robustness checks of their results. They will make presentations based on their project and write up a final project paper.",
