"moduleDescription": "This course introduces the production and consumption of Chinese pop music in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Sinophone worlds in Southeast Asia from the early twentieth century to the present. It uses Mandarin (and dialect) pop music as cases for examining the complex relations between nationalism, regionalism and globalization and their impact on the cultural politics and the processes of identity-construction in the region. Classes will be delivered in both English and Chinese orally, but readings will be mainly in English. Students can choose to complete the assignments in either language.",
