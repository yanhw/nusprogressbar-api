"moduleDescription": "Worldwide, governments are increasingly relying on broad-based consumption taxes, such as the GSTs in Singapore, Malaysia, New Zealand and Australia and the VAT in Europe, to raise revenue. This course will introduce students to theories of comparative tax law and consumption taxation and to key GST law and policy concepts. With these theoretical, conceptual and legal tool kits, we will then explore the complex but fascinating legal and policy issues relating to cross-border trade in goods and services (such as professionals providing services to clients across borders and global digital trade), financial services and real property transactions.",
