"moduleDescription": "The objective of this module is to integrate the various concepts and components of temporary earth retaining structure, underground construction and major geotechnical works design which have been covered in the other modules into a properly executed geotechnical analysis and design project. As such, the student will be advised to take it only either in the last 2 semester. The requirements of the project will include interpretation of site investigation data, derivation of design parameters, use of computer or finite element software for the wall and ground movement as well as drawdown and implications for adjacent structures, design of wall, strutting and waling systems, and proposal of an appropriate ground instrumentation programme. Student will be given a maximum of 2 semesters to complete their projects. At the end of the projects, students will be required to submit a report of their findings and give an oral presentation, which will be graded.",
