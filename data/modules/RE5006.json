"moduleDescription": "This module develops an understanding of the tools for assessing real estate investment opportunities at the macro or portfolio level, as well as the micro or asset level. It covers modern portfolio theory before examining the role of property in an institutional investment portfolio with particular attention given to property portfolio performance analysis, diversification benefits and investment strategy. Real estate asset management involves optimizing the cash flows generated from real estate assets by a direct real estate owner, investor or an organization which incidentally heads, owns or leases real estate to support its corporate mission. This module examines how direct real estate should to be managed proactively to enhance property value or the worth of the business operations the property facilitates.",
