"moduleDescription": "This module examines the interrelationships between transnational corporations (TNCs) and regional development in an era of global economic restructuring. The module seeks to achieve a mixed blend of theory and practice of TNCs and regional development. It provides students with not only description and explanation of TNC operations, but also practical knowledge in analysing the impact of TNCs on regional development. In addition to regular readings, students are expected to conduct specific case studies on the role of TNCs in regional development.",
