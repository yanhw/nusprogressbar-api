The production project provides the graduating cohort with the collaborative experience of mounting a professional theatre production as a company. Working under the guidance of a different guest director each year, students are trained in the various aspects of the production process and performance as actors, stage designers, and production and marketing teams, to develop creative as well as practical skills. This is an essential module for Theatre Studies major students, taken in Year 3 of a student's enrolment.",
