"moduleDescription": "Invasive alien species are a leading global threat to native biodiversity and ecosystem function. They can also have costly impacts on economies, and affect human health and well-being. This module aims to introduce the field of invasion biology and relevant topical and local issues through lectures, directed reading and discussion, and project work. Selected topics will include invasion pathways, prevention and management of biological invasions, invasive plants, urban invasive species, aquatic invasive species, and climate change and invasive species.",
