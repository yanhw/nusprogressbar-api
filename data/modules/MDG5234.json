"moduleDescription": "PhD and MSc candidates may undertake independent study of a topic in bioethics under the supervision of a Centre for Biomedical Ethics (CBmE) faculty. They can formulate a topic of interest in advance and approach their prospective supervisor (with relevant research interests) to discuss and write a proposal for the Independent Study Module (ISM). They are advised to start working on the project several weeks before the start of the semester so that they can have sufficient time for any project revision if necessary. Students and supervisors are required to submit the CBmE ISM Contract agreeing to a plan of work and assessment. Students may check with CBmE to check for the list of ISM projects and prerequisites.",
