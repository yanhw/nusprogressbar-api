"moduleDescription": "From early modern England up into the eighteenth century, English literature registers distinctively a deep fascination with worlds both old and new: Egypt, Africa, China, and India are some examples. In reading critically how different authors in this historical timeline represent old and new worlds in their literary production, this module seeks to analyze the formation of cultural perceptions relating to such topics as (a) the emergence of a colonial and imperial consciousness; (b) the apprehension of cultural difference; (c) the crystallization of national identity. It offers opportunity for considering the engagements of literature with certain momentous social, historical, and political realities, such as the slave trade and the activities of the British East India Company.",
