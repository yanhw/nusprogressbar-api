"moduleDescription": "This module, designed for students with some philosophical training in both western and non-western philosophy, brings together traditions of philosophy that have developed in relative isolation from one another for the purpose of comparing how different cultures have approached and thematized major issues such as knowledge, truth, values (ethical, religious, social, political and aesthetic) and the practices they inform, language and the place of the human. It aims to elucidate the assumptions implicit in different ways of thinking about these issues and investigate how issues may be related in the light of these assumptions.",
