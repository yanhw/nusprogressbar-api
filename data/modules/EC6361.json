"moduleDescription": "The objective of the course is to acquaint students with modern topics, modelling strategies, econometric methods, and empirical work in the field of labour economics. Students are also encouraged to extend the course material to develop their independent research interests that could potentially lead to their Ph.D. thesis topics. This module will provide a solid empirical and theoretical grounding in many areas of labour economics, and prepare students to write a dissertation in the field.",
