It covers fundamental concepts in research design, instrumentation, data collection, and data analysis. This module also introduces basic concepts of statistics such as descriptive statistics, sampling distribution, hypothesis testing. A set of computer lab assignments will give students extensive opportunities to become familiar with the relevant computer software package and experience at computing the various statistics reviewed in the class.",
