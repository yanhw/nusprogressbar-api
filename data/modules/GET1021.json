"moduleDescription": "This course aims to help students think critically through analysing arguments and presenting their arguments effectively. Relevance to engineering practice will be emphasized with reference to Goldberg\u2019s seven missing basics in engineering education. Ideas/claims/assertions/inferences are value driven and their successful communication is structured on sound reasoning and convincing expression. In the course, students will learn critical thinking skills through interaction with and rigorous analysis of various written texts. They will assess the arguments of others and develop their own, support them convincingly and convey them effectively in a critical evaluation and problem-solution research paper.",
