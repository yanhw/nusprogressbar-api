"moduleDescription": "This module will explore the connections between emotions, social life and social identities. It will examine the prevalent sociological and anthropological literature on emotions, morality and consciousness. Attention will be given to the concept of personhood and the cultural meanings circulating through the expression of emotions. We will see how cultural practices serve to organize particular emotional responses to particular social and cultural environments; why collective emotional experiences are regularly mediated by the means of symbolic representations. This course is mounted for all students who are interested in studying the relationships between emotional responses and social experiences.",
