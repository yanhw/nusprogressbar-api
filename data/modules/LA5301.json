The module is named as \u201cGeo design\u201d because it emphasizes on the systematic thinking of site and site alternatives in broad context, in which the analysis is supported by contemporary theories and methodologies in landscape and urban ecology. The tool of geographic information system (GIS) is provided for the development of advanced techniques in analyzing, evaluating, managing, and modeling.",
