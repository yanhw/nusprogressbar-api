"moduleDescription": "Beyond international circumstances, domestic politics and personalities, a vital key to understanding the complexities of United States? foreign policy is through its ideological dimensions. This module will enable students to explore these ideological threads through both seminal documents and scholarly discourses. The module will be taught through both lectures and student presentations. Students will read, present and write on important documents such as John Winthrop?s City upon a Hill, George Washington?s Farewell Address, the Monroe Doctrine, Woodrow Wilson?s Fourteen Points, and George Kennan?s containment policy.",
