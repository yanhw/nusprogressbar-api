"moduleDescription": "This year-long module is designed to get students to think in a practical, problem-oriented, and multidisciplinary way through critical lenses and analytical tools available in the disciplines of Public Management and Leadership, Political Science and International Relations, and Economics, all pillars of a traditional Public Policy education. Students will be presented with an Asia-focused wicked problem, a complex case study, or a hypothetical situation through which they can engage, throughout the year and in a sustained way, central ideas and tools associated with each discipline. The module will be team-taught and enhanced through flipped classroom approaches.",
