"moduleDescription": "Drawing is the most fundamental of media, and is arguably the source out of which all visual art forms emanate. In the broadest sense, drawing would also be the initial notes around which a new business venture is created, a literary narrative shaped, an algorithm developed, a bank heist planned, a satellite designed. From this point of view drawing is in a sense on going creative research that can be applied to any possible field. This course explores the practice in its role as intuitive idea generator, and approaches drawing as a continuum rather than a series of finished projects.",
