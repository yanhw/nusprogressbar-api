"moduleDescription": "This module introduces the language, notions, and methods upon which a sound education in mathematics at the university level is built. Students are exposed to the language of mathematical logic, the idea of rigorous mathematical proofs and fundamental mathematical concepts such as sets, relations and functions. Major topics: Elementary logic, mathematical statements, set operations, relations and functions, equivalence relations, elementary number theory.",
