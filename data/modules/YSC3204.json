"moduleDescription": "Groups are fundamental objects of abstract algebra, and they arise in a variety of contexts. This course introduces group theory through a deep study of permutation groups, symmetry groups, and matrix groups. Examples of group actions play a central role. The course includes a study of subgroups, quotients, and homomorphisms, direct and semidirect products, and other methods of constructing and classifying groups.",
