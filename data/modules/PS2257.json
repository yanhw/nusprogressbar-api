"moduleDescription": "Drawing on the rich social science literature on the government and politics of contemporary Africa, the course will address a set of critical questions that will have important implications for the well-being of the people of the continent and the world in the twentyfirst century. What have been the sources of political and economic crises in Africa? What has been the net impact of the international interventions in the continent in response to these crises? What explains the revival of democracy and economic growth in some parts of the continent? Will it last?",
