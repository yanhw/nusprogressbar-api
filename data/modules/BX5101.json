The course explores the interface of environment and business by examining existing and future-oriented programs, structures, and tools of environmental management, drawing from knowledge of environmental management systems and industrial ecology; by applying tools from financial analysis and accounting to environmental decision-making. by investigating ways in which environmental management can create competitive advantage and by analyzing under what circumstances different competitive approaches are likely to be successful. Targeted Students - For students on the M.Sc. (Environmental Management) program. Research students and students from other graduate program in NUS may apply subject to suitability of candidate and availability of places.",
