"moduleDescription": "Known as the time of the \u201chundred schools of thought,\u201d the Warring States (Zhanguo) period was the formative period of Chinese philosophy and undoubtedly the era of greatest intellectual diversity in all of China\u2019s history. However, the intellectual developments of this period were inseparable from major social, political, economic, and technological changes that the Chinese world was undergoing at the time. This course will examine the political and social changes of the Warring States and preceding Springs and Autumns (Chunqiu) period and explore how all these various historical forces may have shaped the ideologies and debates of the era.",
