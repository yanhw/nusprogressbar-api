"moduleDescription": "How is it possible that only a small number of genes can code for the shape of a tree? Or more generally, where does the complex behaviour so common in the natural world come from? Indeed, how is it conceivable that trillions of neurons create intelligent behaviour? A key to answer these questions lies in interaction and recursion. In this module, the world of complex systems and their fundamental mechanisms are explored through lectures, seminars and hands-on programming. It will be shown how in many cases complex systems can be modelled with recursive processes leading to emergent phenomena that defy an atomic explanation.",
