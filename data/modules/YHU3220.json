"moduleDescription": "On February 4th, 1922, a gathering of peasant protestors from a small North Indian town named Chauri Chaura shouted, \"Long Live Mahatma Gandhi\"as they set fire to the local police station, killing 23 policemen. Chauri Chaura occupies a marginal place in nationalist memory. But it offers important insights into Gandhian nationalism and Indian society. This course will examine the ways in which different social groups received and appropriated Gandhi and his politics. Students will acquaint themselves with an influential twentieth century leader whose legacy was global and study one of the most powerful decolonization movements in the world.",
