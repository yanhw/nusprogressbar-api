"moduleDescription": "What is the form and function of theatricality in contemporary Asian society? This module seeks to answer this question by investigating a range of collective practices of symbolic action and meaning-making that have become known as \"cultural performance\". The methodological perspectives of Performance Studies will be deployed to contextualise cultural performances that contribute so arrestingly to social reality in East and Southeast Asia. Students will participate in a field trip and learn a variety of research techniques such as practice-based inquiry, interviews, performance analysis, historical analysis and visual ethnography to develop individual research projects throughout the semester.",
