"moduleDescription": "In this class, students are introduced to the history and ethnography of work in Southeast Asia. The class focuses on a particular country in the region depending on the instructor. Students read texts that explore the social, political, economic, cultural, and technological forces that have shaped work in the region since the 1800s. At the same time, students are introduced to the practices of ethnographic fieldwork, including observing, interviewing, writing, and editing. Students also read critically ethnographies of work from the region and the world. Students then apply these practices and insights through field research projects.",
