Key planning systems, policy agendas and perspectives are critically assessed. Examples are drawn mainly from rapidly changing regions in Asia. Challenges addressed include infrastructure, land policy, housing, poverty, governance dilemmas and environmental problems. Planning in regions and cities is viewed in light of wider social, political and economic trends as well as the geographical context. Planning is placed into perspective relative to other forces that influence development patterns. The module is aimed at students wanting to understand planning and its place in society.",
