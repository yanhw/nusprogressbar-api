"moduleDescription": "This module teaches writing and critical thinking through a critical exploration of theories of civic and public discourse as they were configured by the ancient Greeks. Topics discussed include the political, ethical, and emotional uses and impacts of civic discourse. The module thus provides the chance for students to gain a critical awareness of the natures of their own engagement with public discourses, to contextualise these discourses both locally and internationally, and to explore the possible futures of communities of which they are a part.",
