"moduleDescription": "The goal of this course is to provide students with a basic introduction to basic concepts, issues, and controversies of legal theory. The course will examine some or all of these topics: utilitarian and deontological moral theories; the relationship between morality and law; natural law and positivism; Critical Legal Studies (CLS); gender and the law; Asian values and jurisprudence, culture and the law; and law and economics. These approaches to law will be examined both in their own right and as perspectives from which positive law might be understood and critically assessed.",
