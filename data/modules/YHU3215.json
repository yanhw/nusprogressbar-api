"moduleDescription": "Over the last 50 years, significant strides and discoveries have been made in China, particularly in the area of archaeology and tomb excavations that have contributed substantially to our understanding of China\u2019s history over the last 5000 years or more. This course seeks to expose students to this body of materials, as a counterpoint to the traditional Chinese textual corpus, as a means of understanding the history of China. In the process, the distinctions and differences between the masses, social and political elite, and the literati classes of Chinese society, and how these segments evolved over time, will be explored.",
