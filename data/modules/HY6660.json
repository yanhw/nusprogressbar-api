"moduleDescription": "Independent research plays an important role in graduate education. The Independent Study Module is designed to enable the student to explore an approved topic in History in depth. The student should approach a lecturer to work out an agreed topic, readings, and assignments for the module. A formal, written agreement is to be drawn up, giving a clear account of the topic, number of contact hours, assignments, evaluation, and other pertinent details. Head's and/or Graduate Coordinator's approval is required. Regular meetings and reports are expected. Evaluation is based on 100% Continuous Assessment and must be worked out between the student and the lecturer prior to seeking departmental approval.",
