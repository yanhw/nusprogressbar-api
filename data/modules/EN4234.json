"moduleDescription": "This module examines the poetics of information in post-industrial society. At its core lies the oeuvre of Thomas Pynchon, whose novels will be read as a critical meta-narrative of the informational turn in Western society since the 1960s. Besides obvious technological effects and the accelerated exchange it enables, how has the new, informational paradigm affected our psychology, everyday life and work; our understandings of place and community, of history and culture? Rather than placing Pynchon within a literary canon, seminars will be thematic studies, drawing on a wide range of critical theory, cultural history, and critiques of globalisation and technology.",
