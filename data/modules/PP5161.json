"moduleDescription": "Complex policy challenges in the 21st century call for fresh approaches and innovative solutions. Scientific evidence suggests that mindfulness will give policy makers an edge in dealing with these problems. Through cultivating and applying mindfulness in the study of key issues in Economics and International Relations, students learn to sharpen their focus, be alert to their biases, open their minds to new possibilities and think holistically. Issues to be covered include paradigms of economic thought, work and productivity, society\u2019s well-being, perceptions and misperceptions of global issues, cognitive biases in decision-making in crisis situations, and the role of joy and International Relations.",
