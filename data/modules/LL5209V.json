"moduleDescription": "This module will focus on the advanced argumentative techniques possible with legal narrative, which refers to how information is selected and organised to construct a persuasive view of the facts. Fact construction plays a particularly prominent role in litigation, but it also appears in methods of alternative dispute resolution and justifications of policy positions. This module will analyze the pervasive reach of fact construction in the law, examine why fact construction is such an effective tool of legal persuasion, and explore advanced techniques of fact construction.",
