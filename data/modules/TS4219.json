"moduleDescription": "This module examines popular media-mediated events &quot;as&quot; performance. The module will investigate the way in which 'mediatised'(i.e. media-mediated) and popular events &quot;perform&quot; and shape the audience's perception of reality. Conversely, the module will also examine how media-mediated performance is influenced by audience interests and perceptions. The focus will be on popular media-mediated events like sports, reality TV, the internet to illustrate how they constitute different modes of performances while sharing similar performativities. The module will also focus on cross-genre, inter-disciplinary performances while also examining notions of the spectacular and spectacle in contemporary visual culture.",
