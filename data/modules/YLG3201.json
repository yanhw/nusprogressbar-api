"moduleDescription": "This course is designed to give students a familiarity with a fuller range of the more complex grammar of Ancient Greek, and to give them an opportunity to read in a more focused manner specific examples of non-adapted ancient Greek texts in the original. Typically, a work of Greek prose (historical and/or philosophical) and a work of Greek poetry will be the focus of reading. As well as gaining a deeper understanding of the syntax, grammar, and the different dialects of ancient Greek, students will develop an increased cultural knowledge in ancient Greek society and literary/ dramatic production.",
