"moduleDescription": "This module introduces students to the theoretical and methodological approaches through which sociologists analyze major historical changes that have deeply shaped the modern world, ranging from the emergence of capitalism and nation-state, revolutions and democracy, empires and colonization, to the formation of modern subjectivity and citizenship. The course will examine various challenges, strategies and reflections on making generalizable arguments based on historical cases and events. Central issues in comparative thinking, understanding of historical specificity and analysis of temporality will be explored.",
