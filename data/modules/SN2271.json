After an introduction into the discipline of Comparative Study of Religion, the history of this discipline, and the different approaches it offers, the great variety of South Asian religions will be described chronologically and studied from a comparative perspective. For each tradition a survey of the relevant original literature will be given. Further themes to be covered are the co-existence of different religious traditions, and the social and psychological implications of religious values, beliefs and rituals.",
