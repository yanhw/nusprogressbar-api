"moduleDescription": "This module will explore the prime ethical issues in an age where new media technologies are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. Central topics addressed will be privacy, surveillance, access, censorship, hacking, intellectual property, mediated identity, and digital rights. The question of how the concept of ethics has changed in the advent of the information society through humanist notions of technological instrumentalism, justice and dignity, and democracy, will be tackled as well. Through a strong focus on critical thinking, students will learn to engage with ethical ambivalences and controversies around everyday new media practices, as well as around the larger impact of communications processes and information technologies on society as a whole.",
