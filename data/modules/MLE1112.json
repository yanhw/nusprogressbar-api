"moduleDescription": "This module is a continuation of MLE1111 deals with the properties, processing and applications of the main classes of engineering materials, namely metals and alloys, ceramics polymers and composites. It will cover Diffusion in solids; Phase diagrams, inclusive of Gibbs phase rule, Binary phase diagram and equilibrium diagrams, isomorphous and eutectic systems; Phase transformation, development of Microstructure and alteration of mechanical behaviour; Corrosion and Degradation. Finally, Economic Environmental and Societal Issues relevant to Materials Engineering will be covered.",
