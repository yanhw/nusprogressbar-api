"moduleDescription": "Cooking has evolved in unexpected ways throughout human history and has always been one of the most important markers of human culture(s). The invention of new technologies, the discovery of new food sources in foreign lands leading to conquest and exploitation, and changing concepts of \u201chealth\u201d, \u201cnutrition\u201d and even \u201ctaste\u201d, etc., have over the centuries redefined what it means to eat and cook. By engaging with scholarly works from various disciplines (as well as films and some popular writing), this course explores major themes that inform the way humans (and pre-humans) prepared their food in different cultures and time periods.",
