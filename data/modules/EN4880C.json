"moduleDescription": "Short stories are often read but are critically neglected, seen as apprentice work by literary historians for the larger achievement of the novel. This module considers the short story as a uniquely mobile modern genre, circulated globally through magazine and newspaper publication and translation. Students will explore the formal and contextual elements of stories from a variety of historical moments and geographical locations, and the manner in which they engage with the political and social transformations that constitute global modernity.",
