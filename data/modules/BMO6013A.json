This course examines what motivates employees to engage in performance related work behaviours, such as task performance and organizational misbehaviour. We address, amongst others, personal characteristics related to work motivation (e.g., needs, attitudes, emotions, cognitions), job characteristics related to work motivation (e.g., autonomy, challenge), situational characteristics related to work motivation (e.g., social support, organizational justice, reward and punishment), and the consequences that follow for employee\u2019s work behaviours.",
