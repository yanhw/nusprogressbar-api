It builds upon the skill sets that RC4 students acquired in junior seminar and senior seminar 1. Students will do individual projects supervised by RC4 fellows; some of them may involve external collaborations, and field work. Intellectual exchanges between supervisors, collaborators, practitioners on the field, and peers will provide a unique experience to students.",
