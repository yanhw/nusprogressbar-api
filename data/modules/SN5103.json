"moduleDescription": "This module aims to introduce graduate students to the historical context of contemporary India after 1947 in terms of key milestone and conjunctures. Using a range of sources available digitally such as newspapers, private papers, oral history and visual material, students will have the opportunity to explore in depth specific episodes, individuals and themes. The module will engage with problems of evidence in terms of objectivity and bias, the challenges involved in framing historical narratives about the recent past and the ways in which these could be subjected to critical interpretation.",
