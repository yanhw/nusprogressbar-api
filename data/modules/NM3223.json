"moduleDescription": "Computers can add randomness, animation, and interactivity to visual collages. This module explores the creation of digital and interactive collage in emerging technological spaces that include mobile devices, networked environments, and new interaction modalities. The module also discusses relevant aesthetic and design theories, concepts, and techniques. The objective of the module is to explore interactive media design in the context of creating interactive works that are meant to be experienced simultaneously as a whole. This module therefore complements issues explored in the module on interactive sequential art, which concentrates on changes that happen over time.",
