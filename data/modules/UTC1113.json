"moduleDescription": "In this junior seminar, we examine ignorance and uncertainty as an essential part of modern life. They take many forms, such as ignorance in science, hope and the optimistic future, ignorance and state power, and the spiritual unknown. Ignorance and uncertainty provide an unexpected vantage point to explore the role of modern knowledge in our society. By critically examining the 'play' of ignorance and uncertainty for central features of modern life, students will build skills such as critical thinking, questioning assumptions, and forming a nuanced and balanced approach to the expectations we place on knowledge.",
