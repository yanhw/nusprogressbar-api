"moduleDescription": "This module introduces contemporary issues shaping our world and the geographical perspectives needed to understand them. Starting with \u2018how geographers view the world\u2019, the module offers a lens to analyse issues like climate change, urban flooding, human-environment relations, challenges of migration, cultural diffusion, economic integration and so forth. Each lecture will touch on contemporary scenarios and geographical analyses of issues. Students will also be exposed to field work techniques and strategies of project management in group discussions and project assignments. The goal is to develop students with strong \u2018geographical imaginations\u2019 better able to understand the world and all its complexities.",
