"moduleDescription": "This module introduces the fundamental principles of water treatment processes. Students will be able to understand water treatment in relation to chemcial equilibrium and kinetics, unit processes and their integration. The applications of these fundamental principles for formulating design and operation for water treatment systems will also be addressed. This course will facilitate students to acquire in-depth knowledge of water treatment systems.",
