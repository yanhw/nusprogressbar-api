"moduleDescription": "This module introduces the concepts of programming from a functional perspective, and is perceived as the first and foremost introductory course to computing. It is the first of a two part series on introductory programming, which also includes CS1102S. This series is characterized by the use of a minimalist syntax of functional languages that enables an emphasis on fundamental programming issues. Topics covered include: overview of programming languages and compilation process, procedural abstraction, recursion, data abstraction, algorithmic strategies, higher-order functions, state mutation, evaluation strategies, debugging and testing. Module activities include lectures, recitation, tutorial and laboratory exercises.",
