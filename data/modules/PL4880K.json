"moduleDescription": "This course examines the various aspects of parental influence on children\u2019s development, with a focus on cultural differences in parenting practices. Topics to be covered include a critical evaluation of the crosscultural relevance of parenting styles and the concept of emotional availability in accounting for differences in children\u2019s developmental outcomes. The notion of \u201cgood enough parenting\u201d and parenting as a bidirectional process will be analysed. The course concludes with a discussion of whether parents are the most important source of influence, bearing in mind the many other domains of influence in children\u2019s lives, such as peers.",
