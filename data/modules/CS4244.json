"moduleDescription": "This is a module that contains both the theory and practice of building knowledge-based systems. The aim of this module is to prepare students so that they can design and build knowledge-based systems to solve real-world problems. The module starts with motivations, background and history of knowledge-based system development. The main content has five parts: rule-based programming language, uncertainty management, knowledge-based systems design, development and life cycle, efficiency in rule-based language and knowledge-based systems design examples.",
