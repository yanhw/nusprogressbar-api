"moduleDescription": "Delivering business value to the organization is a key measure of success for any IT initiative. Perceptions of success are dependent on the stakeholder\u2019s expectations, which may not be perfectly aligned with the intent of the initiative. Typically, the IT Leader needs to manage the expectations of various external and internal stakeholders in the IT eco-system by engaging them and fostering the relationship using his position, personal influence and political savvy; providing necessary and essential guidance, insights and value propositions. This module examines the principles, concepts, and frameworks used in stakeholder analysis to define relevant strategies to manage the relationships.",
