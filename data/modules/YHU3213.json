"moduleDescription": "The Mughals fostered a composite Indic and Perso-Islamic culture in the already pluralistic human landscape of the Indian subcontinent. This course places the institutions of family and household at the center of explorations on Mughal India. Empire-building under the Mughal rulers was intrinsically linked to the production of stratified and heterogeneous households. Students will learn about royal women and how other members of the royal households facilitated the reproduction of state power. We then move beyond royalty to examine the ways in which family was a key site of debate and protest in social movements that emerged during this period.",
