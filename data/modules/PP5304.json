"moduleDescription": "Students will be attached to Singapore Ministries or agencies and participate in a programme of visits to these organisations. The main objective of this attachment is to bridge theory and practice, and provide a strategic overview of policy areas and the processes of policy making. The training will encourage students to explore factors leading to good governance, and is intended to provide a hands-on practical experience in a particular area of interest they may have. Students will be required to present a paper at a seminar at the end of the programme. The module is for MPM students.",
