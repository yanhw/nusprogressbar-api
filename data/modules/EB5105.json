"moduleDescription": "The Enterprise Business Analytics project is designed to be a building block for students to consolidate and put into practice the skills, tools and techniques they have acquired during the Masters programme. This hands-on experience will give students the opportunity to analyze the business needs of a functional area in their organization and suggest and apply Business Analytics techniques to provide business insights and identifiable benefits. The project may take the form of a typical consulting engagement or alternatively, it may involve the experimental application and validation of a Business Analytics technology such as text mining, neural networks etc.",
