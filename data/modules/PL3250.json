"moduleDescription": "This module concerns the application of experimental psychology research to the improvement of human-machine/environment interactions. This is not designed as a \"cookbook\"module where the principles of good human factors are merely enumerated. Rather, the emphasis will be placed on the theoretical principles underlying information processing and human performance. The topics include: signal detection and information theory; attention; spatial displays; navigation; memory and training; selection of action, manual control; time-sharing and workload; and the effects of stress on human error.",
