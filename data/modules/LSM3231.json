"moduleDescription": "This module aims to provide a strong foundation in the study of protein structure and function. The following topics that will be covered: structures and structural complexity of proteins and methods used to determine their primary, secondary and tertiary structures; biological functions of proteins in terms of their regulatory, structural, protective and transport roles; the catalytic action of enzymes, their mechanism of action and regulation; various approaches used in studying the structure-function relationships of proteins.",
