"moduleDescription": "The course will introduce students to the way economists use theories of consumer and producer behaviour, and welfare analysis to analyze complex public policy issues. We begin by formulating the assumptions and basic structure underlying the competitive model. In the process we will point out the strengths and weaknesses of each assumption as a description of the way economic decisions are made. We then proceed to create more realistic models by relaxing some of those assumptions. The emphasis in this class will be primarily theoretical, although how the theoretical models get applied to policy analysis will be continuously stressed.",
