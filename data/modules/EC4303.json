"moduleDescription": "This module is aimed at consolidating what was covered in Econometrics I and II and provide a reasonable training in econometric theory and sound empirical analyses. In addition the module will cover non-linear models, time series econometrics (including cointegration and error correction models), simultaneous equations models and more on other topics such as microeconometrics. The module will be highly useful for honours theses that deal with applied problems.",
