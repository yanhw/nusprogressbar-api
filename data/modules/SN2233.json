"moduleDescription": "India is a large, poverty stricken, rapidly growing economy, which has witnessed substantial changes in its economic orientation and institutions since independence in 1947. This module focuses on economic change from import substitution to globalization, and from the command economy to economic deregulation. It engages with the political economy of India's industrialization, globalization and welfare. Relatively greater emphasis will be placed on the post-cold-war globalized world, which is the period when India embraced globalization and economic deregulation to a much greater extent than in the past.",
