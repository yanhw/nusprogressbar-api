"moduleDescription": "The module provides an intensive 2-week \u201cBootcamp\u201d course aimed at introducing new graduate students from biology or physical science backgrounds to key fundamental concepts and practical approaches in understanding cellular function. The focus is to develop a breadth of knowledge that allows students to pursue further depth in their respective research work. Major topics include the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, gene cloning and editing, microscopy and bioimaging, coding and quantitative methods in biology, the choice and limitations of model organisms. These topics will be covered in lectures and reinforced in thematic-based practicals.",
