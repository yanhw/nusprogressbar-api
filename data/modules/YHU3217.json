"moduleDescription": "Creative nonfiction is a dynamic genre, encompassing several artistic and exploratory practices. Students will learn how to interpret and create nonfiction. Students will look at a different creative nonfiction writing form and how they might adapt it. With readings, discussions, and in-class writing exercises, students explore their concerns and shape them into compelling work. Students will become familiar with diverse approaches to nonfiction across eras and literary movements, be active, critical readers, generate their own essay ideas, and gain experience writing, critiquing, revising on deadline. This course welcomes both newcomers to nonfiction and those with a background in the genre.",
