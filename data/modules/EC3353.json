"moduleDescription": "Can economic analysis contribute to solving the problem of how to design a national health care system, which efficiently responds to consumers' desire for good health? What are the efficient ways of financing healthcare? This module examines these questions through the use of tools of microeconomic analysis and analyzes the behavior of consumers, producers and insurers in the healthcare market. The issue of how healthcare is financed will be examined from the perspective of economic efficiency and equity. The course will also relate the theories developed to current policy issues.",
