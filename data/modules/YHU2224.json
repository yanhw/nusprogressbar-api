"moduleDescription": "\u201cForm,\u201d a wonderfully broad and slippery term, is often used to describe the way a poem deploys its line, rhythm, sound, and how it\u2019s arranged on the page. But form might also describe an ideological project, an organizing idea, what reoccurs and what is conspicuously absent. In this semester-long course, students will explore the fundamentals of poetic form; beginning in traditional (read: Western) prosodic meters and forms, proceeding through Ghazals and the \u201cdeep image\u201d traditions of Latin America and the Middle East, into free verse, contemporary experimental forms and finally, performance poetry and hip-hop.",
