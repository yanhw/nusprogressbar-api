"moduleDescription": "This module focuses on the relationship between space and power. It investigates how political processes shape human geography, and conversely, how assumptions about geography underscore global politics. We will examine key themes, concepts, & theories that define the study of critical politics from a geographical perspective. Students will gain a critical understanding of and appreciation for the historical and contemporary challenges of sovereignty, territoriality, governmentality, identity, citizenship, difference, violence, genocide, colonialism, and war. The module culminates with the themes of resistance, emancipation, direct action, and anarchism, which will allow students to consider alternative configurations of space and power.",
