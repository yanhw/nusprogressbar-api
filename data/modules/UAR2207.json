"moduleDescription": "In diverse cultures, theatre has been viewed as a model for interpreting the wider world. Meanwhile, theatre-makers have historically sought to represent, recreate and indeed transform that world by their actions on stage. This module examines the relationship between world and stage as a means of understanding what theatre is and how it works. Examining a range of theatrical forms and the critical debates they have provoked, students will gain a grounding in key historical and contemporary performance practices, and an appreciation of their often contested place in society. Reflecting this variety, classes will combine seminars, practical workshops, and fieldwork.",
