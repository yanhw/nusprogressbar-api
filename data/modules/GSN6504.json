"moduleDescription": "In this module, we take multidisciplinary approach to understand the cellular and the neural basis of relatively simple behaviours and more complex cognitive tasks. We will discuss: 1. The encoding of noxious stimuli and the neural basis of the affective- motivational and cognitive effects linked to pain 2. The basic elements of the visual system and visual processing in humans and other primates, and the links between cognition (what we see) and behaviour (what we do) 3. Approaches to studying cognition in healthy humans and current insights into how cognitive processes are represented in the brain 4. Animal models of cognitive and behavioural abnormalities associated with psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases",
