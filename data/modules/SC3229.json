"moduleDescription": "While norm violations occur everywhere, the responses to them vary. This module is a comparative study of deviance with a focus on empirical case studies. \u201cNuts, sluts, perverts\u201d is Alexander Liazo\u2019s phrase to refer to deviants from below like mental patients, sex workers and sexual outlaws. \u201cScandals\u201d involve deviance from above, committed by authorities such as clergy abuse, official corruption and corporate malfeasance. Analyzing the range of underdog and elite forms of deviance in terms of disparities in their social constructions, criminal processing and dispensing of justice would enhance our understanding of structures of inequality and power.",
