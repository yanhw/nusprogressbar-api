"moduleDescription": "This module examines the relationship between international law and terrorism. It analyses the challenges that contemporary transnational forms of violence, including terrorism and counterterrorism, pose to the international law of armed conflict. In this context, the module explores the legality and legitimacy of policies such as targeted killing and practices such as suicide bombing. Topics covered by the module include the international law of armed conflict and the contested definition of terrorism, the application of international law to (counter-) terrorist practices, and the legal role of novel state and non-state actors in transnational forms of warfare.",
