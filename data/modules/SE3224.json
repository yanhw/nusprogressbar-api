"moduleDescription": "This module introduces students to the art of Thai painting and drawing through an analysis of both scholarly texts and hands-on sessions. The module takes students on a visual journey through all the major periods of Thai classical art. Emphasis will also be placed on regional and folk styles of painting as well as with new forms of traditional art. The module focuses primarily on the Rama 3 style of Thai painting as developed in nineteenth century Bangkok and which has become the most common form of Thai classical art seen in the country today. Students enrolled in the class will be taught not only how to appreciate traditional Thai painting but also how to draw, create compositions and critique art works.",
