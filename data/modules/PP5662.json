"moduleDescription": "Independent research plays an important role in graduate public policy education. The Independent Study Module is designed to enable the student to research on an approved topic. The student should work with a faculty member to agree on a topic and a list of readings. The faculty member should provide a list of deliverables expected. A formal, written agreement outlining a clear account of the topic, programme of study, assignments and evaluation should be signed by the student and approved by the School prior to the start of the module. The student is expected to meet the faculty supervisor regularly. Evaluation is based on 100% Continuous Assessment.",
