"moduleDescription": "Perhaps the most central and original function of the state is to protect us from each other and mediate our disputes. The very legitimacy of the state \u2013 whether democratic or autocratic - is, in part, dependent on the successful execution of this function. This is perhaps because of the enormous personal, social, and economic costs of crime. Yet many approaches to crime are irrational, wasteful, and harmful to victims, society, and perpetrators alike. This course provides a culturally comparative and multidisciplinary overview of foundational questions related to the nature and prevention of crime, and how states ought best to respond.",
