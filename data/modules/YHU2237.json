"moduleDescription": "Film is a hybrid medium, the meeting point of several others. This course focuses on the relationship of film to theater and painting, suggesting that where two media are in evidence, there is often a third. Topics include space, motion, framing, color, theatricality, tableau vivant, ekphrasis, spectatorship. Readings feature art historical and film theoretical texts and essays pertinent to specific films. The seminar draws on art historical writings to discuss questions of space, perspective, motion, and spectatorship, as well as seminal essays by film theorists to discuss medium specificity, the film image, and filmic space.",
