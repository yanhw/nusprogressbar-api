"moduleDescription": "This course provides an overview of the theory and analytical tools used by economists to analyze alternative regulations and policies for dealing with environmental problems including technology standards, emission taxes,and marketable permits. During this course we will analyze policies addressing various environmental problems including conventional air pollution, overuse of natural resources, and climate change as part of the general focus on the problem of economic growth and efficiency. We will employ tools from microeconomic theory, including consumer theory, firm theory, welfare economics, benefit-cost analysis, and general equilibrium theory to study the relationship between the economy and the natural environment.",
