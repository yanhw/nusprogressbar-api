"moduleDescription": "In this module, students will be exposed to different phonological frameworks (such as Sound Pattern of English and Optimality Theory) and the various phenomena that motivate them. Using this as a stepping stone, this module pursues phonological issues from the perspective of Chinese languages. Students may expect to learn the merits and shortcoming of various theories and their applicability to Chinese languages as well as to other languages. This module seeks to equip students with the ability to develop and evaluate phonological analyses.",
