"moduleDescription": "This module aims to highlight the major economic problems that characterize the present-day developing countries with special reference to ASEAN and East Asian NIEs. While the problems and issues are brought out in a non-technical fashion, the relevant policies are discussed with the help of appropriate empirical evidences so as to allow the students to gauge the extent of success achieved by various policies. The course is likely to impart useful knowledge and information on the prime development issues that concern the developing world today. After the successful completion of the module, students should be able to identify the main problems that are currently faced in Asia and would be able to make some policy suggestions in dealing with these problems. They will also gain some useful experience on the economic development of Singapore.",
