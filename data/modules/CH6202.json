"moduleDescription": "It is generally believed that the system of grammatical rules in a particular language is derived by the application of universally applicable grammatical principles in interaction with language-particular morphological and lexical properties. From this perspective, this module is designed to explore a set of important phenomena observed in the Chinese grammar and to work out with students on how those phenomena can be derived. Students are expected to acquire the knowledge of the universal grammatical principles and to be able to analyze Chinese grammatical phenomena from the perspective of the so-called `Universal Grammar?. This module will be taught in Chinese.",
