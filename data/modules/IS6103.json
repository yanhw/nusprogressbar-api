"moduleDescription": "The information systems field has been energised by a flurry of recent activity that centers on the use of design research as an important research paradigm. This has been widely adopted in the IS (Information Systems) community as Design Science Research (DSR). In this research oriented class, we will introduce students to the DSR area, including its foundation, techniques and exemplars. Various techniques and methods will be discussed and debated.",
