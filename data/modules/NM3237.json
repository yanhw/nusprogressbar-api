The seminar will address such issues as doctor-patient interactions, illness narratives, cultural understanding of health, social support, and health campaigns, mass media theories, technologically-mediated health delivery, and socially constructed health meanings to offer an insight into developing more meaningful communicative practices of healthcare. With an emphasis on application, the course equips students with a foundational understanding of the ways in which health communication projects can be conceptualized and delivered.",
