A qualified student intending to undertake the Honours Thesis will be expected to consult a prospective supervisor in the preceding semester for guidance on the selection of a topic and the preparation of a research proposal. The supervisor will provide guidance to the student in conducting the research and writing the thesis of 10,000 to 12,000 words.",
