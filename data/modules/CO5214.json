"moduleDescription": "This module will enable public health and clinical researchers to critically evaluate the health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of interventions and healthcare programmes. It will provide a foundation for collecting, analyzing and interpreting data that influences decision-making and resource allocation at both institutional and national level. The course will integrate elements of epidemiology, statistics, health economics, and incorporate a diverse range of important subjects including survey methods, decision analysis, and cost effectiveness analysis. Students will also be taught to design their own studies in health services research.",
