"moduleDescription": "The module aims to introduce students to different medical conditions, which demands rehabilitation engineer?s attention. Conditions include neuromuscular disorders, congenital orthopaedic disorders, traumatic injuries, amputation, osteopathy and anthropathy. The students will learn engineering approaches to managing these conditions. Applying methods and materials to design and manufacture devices suited to individuals, in order to achieve functional recovery. The subject focuses on the latest technologies that we have impacted the field of rehabilitation.",
