Through the mentoring from internship managers of the employing companies/ organizations and NUS advisors, students are trained to apply theoretical aspects to solving real problems. Students will learn how policies and practices that they read about are applied in a real world situation. The hands-on experience they gain while on internship will provide an added dimension to their education. It will give them a practical edge and prepare them for work in the future.",
