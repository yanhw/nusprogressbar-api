"moduleDescription": "This module aims to equip students with skills and strategies to discuss fairly complex topics, such as social and cultural issues. Students will also acquire the ability to express their thoughts in writing by using complex structural patterns with conjunctions and transitional phrases. By the end of this module, students should be familiar with the language to the extent of being comfortable in using it as a medium of communication (oral, written, listening, and reading) with native speakers.",
