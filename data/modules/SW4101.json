Students are to examine various social work practice theories in depth and are expected to develop skills in appropriate interventions such as casework, problem solving, family group work, children and youth work, inter-organisational networking and preventive interventions in various settings. Experiential learning and projects are used to develop competence, critical thinking and integration of classroom learning to real life situations. Students are taught to establish ways of engaging in continuous self-learning, self-care and skills development in their professional career as a social worker.",
