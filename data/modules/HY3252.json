"moduleDescription": "This module examines \u201ctropical\u201d medicine in the three related contexts of colonialism, high imperialism, and nation-building. The module will survey medicine, disease, and epidemics in British, American and Japanese practice, spanning the 18th to 20th centuries, and culminating with present-day Asia and the place of biomedicine in contemporary nation-states, including Singapore. The module covers the transformation of a scientific field from a colonial body of knowledge to a form of practice embraced and utilized by post-colonial societies.",
