The module will draw on theories principally developed from first language research. The topics addressed will include theories in writing, composing processes (planning, transcribing, and revising), methodology of writing research (concurrent think-aloud and retrospection), written text features (textual and grammatical), assessment of writing (holistic and analytical rubrics), and characteristics of writers.",
