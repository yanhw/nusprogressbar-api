"moduleDescription": "This subject explores musical figures, genres, styles, and representative works from 1800 to the present in terms of the socio-cultural circumstances from which they emerged. 19th-century Romanticism, the early twentieth century\u2019s exciting innovations, and the more recent pluralism of postmodernism are considered in terms of 5 central themes that span these two centuries. Students will learn to aurally identify musical characteristics of a range of styles and acquire the skills, knowledge, and confidence necessary for their own critical appraisal of, and independent research into the repertoire that they listen to and play.",
