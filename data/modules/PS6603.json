"moduleDescription": "The module provides graduate students with intensive, focused, and hands-on training in specific advanced research methods. It introduces students to and familiarizes them with such advanced quantitative and qualitative methods as multiple regression, structural equation modeling, qualitative comparative analysis, experimental design, and interpretative methods. Unlike existing methods modules, which aim to provide a general introduction to a wide variety of research methods, this module focuses on the development of highly specific methodological skills.",
