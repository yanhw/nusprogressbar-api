"moduleDescription": "Why did China make such a deep impression on Europe? In this upper level history course, we explore the entangled history of Europe and China from the sixteenth century to the present. What did China mean to Europeans, what were the sources of information upon which they formed their impressions, and why did European attitudes towards China change over time? We will conclude the course by turning the tables and examining Chinese perceptions of and attitudes towards Europeans.",
