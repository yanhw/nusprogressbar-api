"moduleDescription": "Many forms of inter-personal violence such as honor killings, dowry deaths, witch-hunts, female infanticide, are attributed to differences in culture (norms, beliefs, values, social capital, and identities). Competing explanations link these forms of violence to economic and political causes such as property rights, repression by political elites, and political competition between religious groups. We will study the micro foundations of culture, and critically examine the relationship between culture and inter-personal violence using some theoretical and mostly empirical literature. We will examine the efficacy of interventions such as legislative change, economic incentives, and civic engagement to alleviate these forms of violence.",
