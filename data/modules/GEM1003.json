The module will also introduce students to the various forms of classical and contemporary performance practices and their attendant modes of analyses: combining play analysis, theatre history & theory. Using complementary content-centred lectures and practice laboratory, the module creates an environment where students simultaneously engage with module content while investigating its relations to the creation of theatre and performance.",
