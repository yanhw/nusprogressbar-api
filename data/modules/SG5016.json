"moduleDescription": "Technology innovation enables organisations to identify and develop tools and methods to grow new lines of revenue; or to solve operational productivity challenges. However, when combined with other business process improvements, and coupled with judicious use of technology, organisations can sometimes revolutionise their business transformation. This course shows how a mix of business methods and technology can be ingredients in the process of change; and the ability of organisations to manage such a change is the basis for business transformation. It provides the participants with various approaches, tools and techniques to transform their organisation and a methodology to manage change.",
