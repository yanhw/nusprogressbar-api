Normally they are interviewed about an issue or event of personal or social meaning. Students will consider concepts of history, authenticity, and authorship in reality theatre works that are based upon direct testimony and recorded materials, and will work in groups to develop an original work of reality theatre. Students will be expected to perform in front of others.",
