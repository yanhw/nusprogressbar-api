"moduleDescription": "As a progression from the design fundamentals, this module aggregates all the prior lessons into one complete, coherent, industrially-relevant project where students learn to manage, and go through the whole process of 1) initial design research and market research, to 2) formulating the design strategy and 3) design brief, through to 4) conceptualization, 5) evaluation phases, and 6) detailing and refinement. The design is aimed for a specific context which includes specific users, market scenarios, environments, trends, business / competition, and feasibility / manufacturing factors. Critical consideration for sustainability factors is incorporated as part of the context criteria.",
