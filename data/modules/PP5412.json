"moduleDescription": "International Relations (IR) is a key component of public policy initiatives. Public policy graduates will need a firm grasp of IR issues and concepts when crafting policies. This course introduces some of the key issues and principles of global and international affairs. It conceptualizes and contextualizes global public policy through the academic discipline of IR. Early sessions cover core IR theories, integrating concepts to develop understanding of global public policy as a complex interplay between power and interests, institutions and norms, and diverse actors. Later these ideas will be applied to three vital issue areas: security, insecurity, and war; international trade and finance; and global public goods. The course is team-taught, with faculty members covering topics from their own research and policy interests.",
