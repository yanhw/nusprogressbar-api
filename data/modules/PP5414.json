This module provides a comprehensive coverage of sustainable development and is structured on the following premises: (1) The natural environment is the core of any economy and economic sustainability cannot be attained without environmental sustainability; and (2) Sustainable development requires the maintenance of a steady stock of environmental capital. The module is designed to enable graduates to work in multidisciplinary teams, to understand the sustainable development perspective and to be able to critique policy and practice. The module has a constructive alignment between outcomes, activities, and assessment tasks set at a postgraduate level.",
