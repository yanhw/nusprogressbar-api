"moduleDescription": "This course reviews historical and cultural perspectives of the psychology of gender. Various genetic, biological, and social determinants of gender differences in physical and sexual attributes, cognitive abilities, personality, and social behaviours are examined. Socialization processes by way of parenting, play, school and media will be explored with regard to gender roles and stereotypes. Consequences of gender bias will be discussed in relation to individual development, education, vocation, media, and physical and mental health. New trends in gender relations, as well as gender conflicts and abuses of power such as battering, sexual assault, and sexual harassment will be explored.",
