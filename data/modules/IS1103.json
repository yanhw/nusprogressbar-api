"moduleDescription": "Students will explore the interactions and impacts of computing & information technologies on social systems. They will examine how technological paradigms transform industries, organizations and individuals, and vice versa; how policies and social norms are developed as they relate to technology use; and investigate the emerging controversies surrounding the regulation of technology in society. Emphasis is placed on establishing an in-depth understanding of the professional and ethical responsibilities of computing professionals, and developing an ability to analyze the impact of computing technologies on a local and global scale. Historical and contemporary studies, cases and examples will be used extensively.",
