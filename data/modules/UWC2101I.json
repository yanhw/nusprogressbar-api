"moduleDescription": "This module will develop students' critical reading and writing abilities through an active, seminar-style engagement with a variety of materials related to the nature and impact of modern consumer culture. We will begin by examining a number of key theoretical positions concerning the relationship between human nature and the need or desire for material things. Once we have interrogated some of these arguments, we will examine the phenomenon of modern advertising and consider the extent to which individual ads shape our buying habits and even our values. The module concludes by investigating the relationship between today's corporations and youth culture.",
