"moduleDescription": "Can facts be assembled to reveal the truth of an event? Is it possible the truth of an event can be subjective? Looking at classic and current examples of non-fiction crime and disaster writing, we will explore the craft of writing on sensitive subjects with objectivity and clarity. Crime and disaster stories require detailed anecdotes and descriptions to hold the reader. But they often draw upon official documents that are sometimes bland statements of fact, eyewitness accounts that vary greatly, or the seemingly hidden world of text and social media. We will cast a critical eye over this process of building essays reports or memos with facts and interviews and discuss how some of the best writers in the business get it right, or not.",
