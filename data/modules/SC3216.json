"moduleDescription": "This module is about the anthropology and sociology of understanding what it means to be a \u2018self\u2019 in \u2018society,\u2019 that is, to be a \u2018social self.\u2019 This course is NOT about a psychological study of the self. It analyses important theoretical debates about and ethnographic studies on the relationship between society and the self. Particular attention will be paid to examining how ideas about the self are socially constructed and re-constructed by various processes, especially the roles played by the state and its institutions in shaping perceptions and practices the self in relation to ethnicity, the family, gender, marriage, work, leisure and friendship.",
