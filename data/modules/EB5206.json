"moduleDescription": "Effective logistics and supply chain management requires strategic, quantitative and tactical techniques that can be harnessed through data analytics and intelligent methods. This course introduces data analytics from the perspective of a decision support system (DSS) with emphasis on integration of information, inventory, transportation and location of material, capital and human resources. Through a series of workshops, simulations and case studies, the course provides a tool-kit that is built on forecasting, networking and warehousing algorithms that contribute towards optimized decision making vis-\u00e0-vis cost control, operations and stakeholder relationship management.",
