"moduleDescription": "The theme of search for meaning and happiness via rebellion of human spirit over the imposition of conformity is studied with a theoretical approach to existentialism in works of the prominent 20th century writers: Chinese Wang Xiaobo, Czech/French Milan Kundera, Russian Alexander Solzhenitsyn, and Singaporean Goh Poh Seng. Students are expected to highlight quotes of their own interest in each novel, which they will share during discussions. They submit a 350-word critical summary of novels before each class. A final paper of 8 pages and 2-page-scene (700 words) of creative fiction writing is expected at the end of the course.",
