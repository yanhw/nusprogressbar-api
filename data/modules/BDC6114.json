We will start with an introduction including definition of logistics and supply chain management, key supply chain costs and metrics, and fundamental issues and trade-offs in supply chain management. We will then discuss the interactions between stages in a supply chain, double marginalization and contracts for supply chain coordination, strategic alliances and incentive alignment, channels of distribution, coordinating distribution strategies, pricing/promotions. We will also discuss supply chain planning, facility location models, and vehicle routing models.",
