"moduleDescription": "Ballet, modern dance, popular dance: how can we understand dance as an art form with its own theories and history, like visual art? This course surveys the history and central concerns of twentieth-century dance in the West. We will consider dance\u2019s important connections to visual art; dance as an expression of national identity and the human condition; Concepts such as \u2018natural\u2019 bodily movement and Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution; the \u2018primitive\u2019 in modernist visual art and in dance; gender and the feminist critique of ballet and modern dance; and dance\u2019s theorising of bodily presence. Assessments include critical and analytical essays, presentations.",
