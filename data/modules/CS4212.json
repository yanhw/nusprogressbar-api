"moduleDescription": "The objective of this module is to introduce the principal ideas behind program compilation, and discusses various techniques for program parsing, program analysis, program optimisation, and run-time organisation required for program execution. Topics covered include regular expressions, context-free grammars, lexical analysis, syntax analysis; different algorithms for parsing codes, such as top-down parsing, bottom-up parsing; translation to abstract syntax using modern parser generator technology, intermediate representation, semantics analysis, type system, un-optimised code generation, code optimisation, data-flow analysis, instruction scheduling.",
