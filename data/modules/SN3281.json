The lectures will be based on historical analysis and effects of the colonial enterprise, different business communities and their networks, post-colonial approaches and changes in the socio-political and economic trajectories. It gives students opportunities to look into the traditional big business houses and corporations and the subsequent changes in the present generations, and also into the emerging paradigms of new production networks and their relevance in the South Asian economies as well as in Asia and the world.",
