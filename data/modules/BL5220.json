"moduleDescription": "In recent years, research in life sciences and biomedical research in particular is gaining importance. Hence, it is essential for graduate students to have a good understanding of animal development. This module is designed to provide students with a series of lectures on invertebrate as well as vertebrate development. It also encompasses recent and relevant advances in the field of animal development and differentiation. In addition to the lectures, the students have time for critical discussion sessions with the lecturers, many of whom are pioneers in the topics being covered in the course. Intended for both new and advanced graduate students familiar with basic animal development",
