"moduleDescription": "This module introduces students to the rationale for, and process of, the emergence and growth of Singapore?s built environment from a third world country to a world class city. It enables students to have an understanding and appreciation of the economic and social aspects and implications of how properties and infrastructure are developed and managed, given the constraints that Singapore faces. It also encourages them to develop alternative views on how the built environment can help Singapore continue to prosper and remain relevant in the region. This module is open to all undergraduates who are interested in Singapore?s physical development.",
