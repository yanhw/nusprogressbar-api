"moduleDescription": "This module examines the intellectual foundations, rationale, relevance and practicality of non-violence in the political arena. Reading early arguments for non-violent direct action in the writings of early 19th century thinkers, such as Leo Tolstoy, John Ruskin and Henry David Thoreau, the module analyses the effectiveness of non-violence as a political strategy in Gandhi's campaign for India's independence, the American Civil Rights Movement, and Nelson Mandela's struggle to liberate South Africa from Apartheid. To prepare for this module, it is suggested that students have taken PS3233 Political and International Ethics.",
