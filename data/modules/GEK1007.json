"moduleDescription": "The module aims to provide a general understanding of traditional China by focusing on two important aspects of its civilization: history and literature. In the first half of the semester, students will be introduced to the major political, intellectual, and social developments in the various dynasties of imperial China. In the second half of the semester, the module calls attention to the major literary genres that dominated each historical period, from the pre-Qin era through the Tang dynasty. In so doing, we offer students an overview of what formed the cornerstone of the civilization of traditional China. (This module is taught in English.)",
