The emphasis of the module is on the impact of external actors on Southeast Asia, albeit the module will also deal with regional developments and indigenous initiatives. Initially, the module will deal with past developments that affected the region. The second half will deal with more contemporary regional developments, some of which are still ongoing. This module will be extremely useful for students who would like to understand regional political issues.",
