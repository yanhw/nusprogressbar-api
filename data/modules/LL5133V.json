"moduleDescription": "Firstly, to impart a solid grounding in the history, principles, norms, controversies and institutions of international human rights law. Secondly, to undertake a contextualized socio-legal study of human rights issues within Asian societies, through examining case law, international instruments, policy and state interactions with UN human rights bodies. 'Asia' alone has no regional human rights system; considering the universality and indivisibility of human rights, we consider how regional particularities affect or thwart human rights. <br><br> Subjects include: justiciability of socio-economic rights, right to development and self-determination, political freedoms, religious liberties, indigenous rights, national institutions, women's rights; MNC accountability for rights violations.",
