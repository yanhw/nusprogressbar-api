"moduleDescription": "This seminar attempts to explore the relationality between seeing and knowledge. It begins with a meditation on the phrase \u201cseeing is believing\u201d; and questions the privileging of sight over all the other senses.

And if they are intimately related, what are the implications on knowledge? Are we all potentially blind to our own insights?",
