"moduleDescription": "This course is designed to introduce students to certain areas of financial economics. It attempts to develop a theoretical foundation for choice under uncertainty, portfolio analysis and equilibrium asset pricing models. A considerable portion of the course will also be devoted to the fixed-income securities and derivative securities. Since this is an economics course in a liberal arts and sciences setting, we will emphasize economic concepts whenever possible, and spend time on the intellectual and economic development of investment analysis.",
