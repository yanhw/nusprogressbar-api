"moduleDescription": "The module offers a critical introduction to essential concepts, approaches, and analytical tools in social policy from a comparative perspective with the purpose of improving the design of social policies. It will focus on the substance and context of social policies, the forms in which they are delivered and financed, and how they might be improved. Adopting a problem-solving approach from a design perspective, we will first understand the scope and magnitude of a number of social problems and then explore ways to address them effectively. To maintain focus, we will concentrate on education, health, housing, and pension in select countries in East, South and Southeast Asia.",
