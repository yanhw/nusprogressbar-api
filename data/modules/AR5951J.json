This module will present drawing as the primary instrument for intellectual and critical discourse in architecture. It will present a historical and theoretical overview of drawing along with practical reviews of the varying drawing techniques. Based on their understandings of the history, theory, and techniques of drawing, students will explore and propose alternative manifestations of architectural drawing. The coursework will entail weekly textual and graphic assignments.",
