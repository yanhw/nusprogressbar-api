We will examine the Heavenly Master movement of the 3rd century, the Supreme Clarity revelations of the 4th century, and the Precious Treasure liturgies and scriptures of the 5th century, and Tang ordination texts. This course will focus on reading and interpreting original texts, introduce key concepts and methods for the study of Chinese religions and examine the relationship between Taoist ritual and popular cults.",
