"moduleDescription": "Everyday narratives are those informal stories we tell each other about ourselves and our quotidian experiences. In this module, such narratives will be analyzed in terms of identity politics, how they instantiate social power, and how they frame epistemological knowledge, such as scientific discourse, not normally associated with narrative as a mode of representation. Students will generate a corpus of genuine sociolinguistic narrative data and analyze it in an interdisciplinary framework.",
