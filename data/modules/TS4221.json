"moduleDescription": "Doing performance can teach us things that watching it cannot. This module uses performance practice as a research methodology to investigate otherwise inaccessible questions of creativity, embodiment, and performance processes. The three main components of the module include: defining a research question, designing and conducting experiments/observations, presenting the outcomes. Students will conceptualize and execute their own research project, in a relationship of collaborative research with artists. The nature of the project determines the resulting presentation: multi-media talk, lecture-demonstration, or short performance or workshop. The module will also focus on case studies from a range of cultural and stylistic sources.",
