"moduleDescription": "This module provides professional practice experience related to the theoretical foundations of intervention and management covered in SLP 5110 and SLP 5111 and previous modules. Students will undertake an intensive block (5-6 weeks) of direct clinical experience in one clinic, either in a hospital or a community setting, under the supervision of an experienced speech and language pathologist. The focus of this third placement will be on the continued development of clinical skills in planning and carrying out intervention with adult and/or paediatric clients with communication and/or swallowing impairment. If considered appropriate by their supervising clinician, students may progress to independent management of one client at entry level by end of placement.In addition, students will participate in a 30-hour direct clinical experience involving assessment and clinical management of clients, from one of a range of specific client groups over an approximately 6 week period.",
