"moduleDescription": "Singapore is a small city-state, the U.S. a continental superpower. There seems to be a huge power imbalance between the two countries, but are things always the way they seem? This module introduces various dimensions of American global power such as cultural power (Hollywood, for example, or American democracy as an inspirational model), military might and economic size. We investigate how U.S. power affects Singapore and its relations with its Asian neighbours. We also look at how Singapore and the region respond to the global projection of American power, and the ways they may exert power despite apparent imbalances.",
