"moduleDescription": "In South Asia, marriage is classically understood as an alliance between families or social groups for economic, social and political reasons. However, as recent studies show, the notions of love, marriage and sex intersect with political, and legal structures, on the one hand, and notions of gender, morality, and modernity on the other. Through this course, we critically analyse such regnant claims and examine how love and sex are shaped politically, culturally, legally and ideologically. Moreover, by studying the intersecting fields of \u2018marriage, love, and sex,\u2019 we unpack such dualities as \u2018private/public,\u2019 \u2018individual/community, and \u2018modern/ traditional\u2019 in South Asia.",
