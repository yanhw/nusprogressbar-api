"moduleDescription": "Through this module students engage with key contemporary global/regional events, issues and changes through geographical lenses. The events, issues and changes selected for geographical analysis will vary each year so the module remains contemporary. Students will draw upon their accumulated geographical knowledge to research, analyse and interpret the selected events. Working in self-defined sub-disciplinary groups (climate change geography, geomorphology, social, economic, political geography etc.) students will be assigned research and evaluation tasks to bring their particular critical perspective (connected with academic debates) to a selected event, for example, the 2010 earthquake in Haiti or food insecurities.",
