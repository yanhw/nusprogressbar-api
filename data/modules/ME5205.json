"moduleDescription": "The objective of this course is to approach the study of energy conversion systems from an overall thermo-economic perspective. Students will gain the ability to integrate the various energy related topics covered in the undergraduate programme to evaluate the performance and make economic decisions on energy systems. The module will cover the following topics: energy perspectives, energy sources, thermodynamic aspects of energy conversion systems, performance evaluation of energy systems, improvement of energy efficiency, energy management, environmental aspects of energy use, thermo-economics, future trends in energy conversion, introduction to energy policy issues.",
