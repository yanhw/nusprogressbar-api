"moduleDescription": "Learning objectives: To understand the basic principles of analytical techniques. To apply the analytical techniques to study bulk-drug pharmaceuticals, quality control. To get hands-on experience with analytical instrumentation and application to real-life problems.Major topics: Basic principles of the following techniques will be covered: nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; electrochemistry and potentiometric titration; chromatography-column, TLC, paper, size-exclusion, HPLC and gas chromatography; atomic absorption and flame photometry. Analytical method validation and development, guidelines of ICH and FDS. Application of these analytical techniques in bulk-drug pharmaceuticals, quality control and structural elucidation.Target students: Pharmacy Year Three",
