"moduleDescription": "Environmental Law is emerging as a distinct field of law in every nation and region. Legislatures establish environmental laws based upon the need to address perceived environmental problems in their territory or in a region of shared resources such as a river basin or coastal marine regions or the habitats for migratory species. In some instances, national legislation is stimulated by the negotiation and adherence to multilateral environmental agreements.",
