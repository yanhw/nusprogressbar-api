"moduleDescription": "This module is meant for entering graduate students who want to do computational biology but without the undergraduate module. This syllabus is similar to CZ4225 but the workload is higher. Proteins: sequence =>structure =>function. Protein structural organizations and families. Basic modeling and simulation techniques. Protein structural modeling: homology modeling, threading, ab initio methods. Cell as a complex machine: Genetic and protein circuits (pathways). Deveolpment of a mathematical model of pathways. Computer simulation of pathways.",
