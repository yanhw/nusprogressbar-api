"moduleDescription": "Biotechnology is a rapidly growing field encompassing many disciplines and the objective here is to give broad exposure to students to encouraging multi-disciplinary thinking. Four broad areas are identified to allow some flexibility in the choice of contemporary topics. A broad introduction to this module is given under Emerging Disciplines in Biology. Interfacing Biology and Engineering delves into some of these diverse topics in some detail. Biocomputing focuses on the central role of software tools that complement experimental approaches in many applications. Under Entrepreneurship, innovation processes and the characteristics of the various related industry sectors such as Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology and Healthcare will be discussed.",
