"moduleDescription": "This course introduces students to the three main streams of IR theory: realism, liberalism, and constructivism. In particular we will explore theories of the balance of power, the balance of threat, the rise and decline of great powers, hegemony, cooperation theory, the role of international institutions in global governance, and the structures and relations of identity between and among states and societies. Major contemporary issues that will be addressed include the relations between China and the United States; the global political economy, including trade and development, and the prospects for global cooperation on issues such as climate change.",
