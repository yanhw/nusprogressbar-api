"moduleDescription": "This module investigates geographical aspects of recent and future climate change, especially at regional and local spatial scales. The following major topics will be introduced, with greater focus in places depending on the specialisation of the lecturer(s). 1. The physical science of climate change, which include observational and modelling techniques and evidence; 2. Sectorial and multi-scale impacts on natural and human systems, which include vulnerability frameworks, and communicating aspects of climate change; 3. Adaptation, mitigation measures and sustainable development, which include technological developments, risk and decision making under uncertainty, governmental responses and socioeconomic assessments of climate change mitigation.",
