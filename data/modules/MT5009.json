"moduleDescription": "The aim of this module is to help students understand how technological change creates opportunities for new products and services. Students learn about how improvements in performance and cost, including the drivers of them, cause new technologies to become economically feasible over time. This is done in general and for many specific technologies. This enables students to better understand the timing of economic feasibility and thus the opportunities that are currently emerging for specific technologies.",
