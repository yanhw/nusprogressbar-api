"moduleDescription": "This is an applied module where students will be challenged to investigate and explore new trends in social and community development. The module will have a very strong field component where students will be required to conduct independent investigation into new and developing fields. Students will investigate the extent to which theories and hypotheses discussed in class apply in real field settings. Students will also be required to develop new programmes in the community based on the theories discussed in class. The primary objective is to equip the students with the knowledge and skills in understanding the processes of community change and effecting community change.",
