"moduleDescription": "This module explores the history of Myanmar (Burma). Organized chronologically from the emergence of the earliest polities to the present, students will examine the formation and interaction of communities, ideological worldviews, ethnic identities, and material cultures that have characterized the societies that evolved along the Irrawaddy River basin and beyond. Module content will consider the particulars of Myanmars history (early stateformation and the historical development of Burmese identity) within regional/global processes and themes. Fundamentally, this module addresses why contemporary Myanmar is perceived to be so different from its regional neighbours despite sharing many historical and cultural experiences.",
