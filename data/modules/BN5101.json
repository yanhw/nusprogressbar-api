"moduleDescription": "This course will provide an indepth study of today\u2019s state-of-art medical devices technologies. The module will undertake an approach that will engage with students latest medical technologies through a system based overview using engineering standards. This module will also introduces some of the major focus of today\u2019s biomedical engineering research systems, like Medical Therapies and Technologies (MTT), Biomechanics & Mobility Research (BMR), and Molecular Engineering & Design. Exposure to these fields will allow students will make use of the knowledge of these systems to help them design and develop novel medical devices.",
