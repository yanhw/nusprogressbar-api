"moduleDescription": "Family is often considered the foundation of society. Families affect the way we live, play, and work, shaping our values and how we relate to others. In this module, students will investigate and engage with issues that surround and define what it means to be a Singaporean family in the 21st century. They will look at issues such as broken and singleparent families, foster care, family leisure, family businesses etc - through economic, social, and psychological perspectives. The module emphasises experiential learning and application of readings outside the classroom through field trips, guest speakers and discussions/interviews with families and communities.",
