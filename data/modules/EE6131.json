"moduleDescription": "This course covers various basic and selected advanced topics in wireless communication. It begins with an overview of current wireless systems and standards, followed by a mathematical characterization of the wireless channel. It then examines the fundamental capacity limits of wireless channels and the characteristics of the capacity-achieving transmission strategies. This part is followed by practical digital modulation techniques and their performance under wireless channel impairments, including diversity techniques to compensate for flat-fading, multicarrier modulation to combat frequency-selective fading, and multiple antenna space-time communications. The course concludes with a discussion of various practical multiple access schemes in wireless cellular systems.",
