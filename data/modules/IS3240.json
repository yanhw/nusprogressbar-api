"moduleDescription": "We are living in a \"New Economy\"with e-business. E-Business means not only \"selling products electronically\"but also digitalisation of many conventional business processes: financing, advertising, and managing human resources. These process-related changes significantly impact intra-business organisation, business-to-business relationships, and business-to-consumer interactions. As technology advances breathlessly, the ideas, concepts, and models of economic principles need to be applied carefully. The economic analyses, such as differential pricing, bundling, signalling, licensing, lock-in, or network effects can be directly applied to E-Business economy. This course aims to give students economic insights to understand E-Business and to make better decisions in E-Business.",
