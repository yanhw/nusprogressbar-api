"moduleDescription": "This topic-based module develops quantitative reasoning skills through a structured analysis of one important but accessible problem, imparting to students the appreciation that, for many questions/issues, a quantitative analysis can provide the insight and clarity that complements and moves beyond what might be gained through a qualitative approach. In this particular iteration of the module, we will learn to make appropriate measurements to quantify the ecofootprint arising out of our current personal lifestyle choices, conduct systematic thought/real experiments to explore improvement opportunities, and propose a modelbased sustainable alternative for ourselves, our families or communities such as the USP Residential College.",
