Concepts relating component items and process steps to value-added functions are introduced as a precursor to the analysis of system cost over the entire life cycle of products and services. It also deals with tools and approaches to select equipment, materials for cost-effective operations. This module enables students to cost out a system and recommend approaches to develop strategies for increasing the cost effectiveness of the system.",
