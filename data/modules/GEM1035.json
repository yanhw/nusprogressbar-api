We will look at some of the popular understandings of emerging adulthood by studying an age group of people called \u201cadultolescents\u201d, \u201ctwixters\u201d, or \u201ckippers\u201d. We will also critically analyse aspects of emerging adulthood with regards to education, job opportunities, love and marriage, as well as parenting. Finally, we reflect on the kind of citizens these emerging adults are becoming, how they can engage in the community, and what the future holds for them.",
