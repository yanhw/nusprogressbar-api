"moduleDescription": "This module introduces students to the fundamental concepts of Statics and Mechanics of Materials and their applications to engineering problems. At the end of this course, students are expected to be able to: draw a free body diagram and identify the unknown reaction forces/moments; solve statically determinate problems involving rigid bodies, pin-jointed frames and cables; solve statically indeterminate axial force member problems using a simple stress-strain relationship and compatibility equations; determine the shear stress and angle of twist of torsional members; draw bending moment and shear force diagrams for a transversely-loaded beam; determine the stresses and deflections in transversely-loaded beams.",
