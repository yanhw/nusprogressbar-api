"moduleDescription": "The module distributed autonomous robotic systems will cover topics such as multi-agent systems, multiple robotic systems and computational intelligence. The tools presented include genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, soft computing and multi-objective optimisation. Some applications to pattern recognition, function mapping, sensor fusion, obstacle avoidance and learning in robotic systems are also presented.",
