"moduleDescription": "The purpose of this course is to make in-depth analysis and understand various theoretical issues of modern industrial organisation. This course will also provide a platform for research students interested to work in the area of industrial organisation. The courses are directed to develop the analytical skills of the students so that they can handle the deeper issues in their future independent research career. The approach of this course will be game theoretic. In the beginning, basic concepts of non-cooperative game theory will be reviewed in detail. This will lay the foundation to study various applications of game theoretic models in the field of industrial organisation.",
